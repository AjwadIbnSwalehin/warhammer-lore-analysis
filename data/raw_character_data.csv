Roboute Guilliman,"Roboute Guilliman (pronounced Ruh-BOOT-ay GIL-li-man), sometimes referred to as the ""Avenging Son"", ""The Victorious"", ""The Master of Ultramar"" and ""The Blade of Unity"", is the primarch of the Ultramarines Space Marine Legion and its myriad subsequent Successor Chapters. He is the current Lord Commander of the Imperium and the ruling Imperial Regent who serves as the chair of the Senatorum Imperialis.
 Held by some as a paragon among the Emperor's gene-sons, Roboute Guilliman was as much a patrician statesman and empire-builder as he was an indefatigable warrior. A being of preternatural intelligence, cold reason and indomitable will, Guilliman forged his XIIIth Legion into a vast force of conquest and control, a weapon by which he made himself the master of a stellar domain in the Eastern Fringe of the galaxy, the Realm of Ultramar, which during his early lifetime spanned five hundred worlds.
 Before He began His conquest of the galaxy, the Emperor of Mankind created the primarchs. Utilising incredible skills of genetic engineering, and the phenomenal psychic power bound into His own form, He forged twenty demigod gene-sons in the laboratories He built beneath the Himalazian Mountains on Terra. These were superlative transhuman warriors, strategists and leaders, the finest qualities of Humanity refined in the crucible of science and magnified through the lens of divinity and the power of the Immaterium. 
 The Emperor intended the primarchs to stand at His side during the Great Crusade, each leading one of the twenty Space Marine Legions to glory beyond imagination. Before that plan could come to pass, the Dark Gods of Chaos intervened. They snatched up the nascent primarchs and scattered them through the Warp, so that each came to rest upon a different one of Humanity's far-flung worlds. Some say that it was at this time that the Ruinous Powers left their mark upon the Emperor's gene-sons, and that this is why fully half of the primarchs betrayed their father and the Imperium during the Horus Heresy.
 Whatever the case, Roboute Guilliman was not tainted in such a fashion. The being that would become the primarch of the Ultramarines Legion came to rest upon the world of Macragge. There he was discovered, and adopted, by a local warlord named Konor. Growing and developing at a superhuman rate, Konor's adoptive son soon surpassed all those around him, and came to be the greatest warrior, strategist and statesman upon Macragge. After Konor was slain by a treacherous ally, it was Guilliman who avenged his foster father, before taking upon himself the mantle of kingship. The entirety of Macragge was swiftly unified beneath the banner of Roboute Guilliman, becoming a world of peace, civilisation, wisdom and strength. Guilliman was a charismatic and gifted leader, beloved of his people and singularly capable of compartmentalising incredible quantities of information. He was an organiser, a logistician, one capable of turning the wildest theories into practical reality and rendering order from chaos.
 When the Emperor's crusading forces finally reached Macragge in 837.M30, the son was reunited with his true father. Guilliman was given charge of the Ultramarines Legion, and wasted no time in putting his stamp upon it. In the conquests that followed, the Ultramarines became renowned as true exemplars of what it meant to be a Space Marine. Under Guilliman's leadership they became arguably the most strategically gifted and tactically balanced of all the Legiones Astartes. Working on the basis of theoretical situations and practical solutions, the Ultramarines fought with exceptional efficiency. They drove the foes of Humanity before them, their armies fighting like intricate and perfectly tuned machines to swiftly and decisively outmanoeuvre every foe.
 When the Horus Heresy erupted and set the galaxy ablaze, Roboute Guilliman fought with loyalty and determination for the Imperium that he believed in with all his heart. When he thought that the Emperor had fallen, the primarch established a new seat of power on Macragge, planning to preserve the Emperor's secular purity and Imperial Truth within his own Realm of Ultramar as the Imperium Secundus. 
 When Guilliman later learned that Terra still stood, he did everything in his power to ensure that he and his loyal primarch brothers could fight at their father's side in the final battle against Horus. Though his efforts benefitted many, Guilliman himself reached Terra too late to save his father, a fact that would torture him for solar decades to come.
 In the wake of the Horus Heresy, it was the Ultramarines primarch who wrote and instituted the Codex Astartes, a key volume that laid out the proper tactics and military organisation for the majority of Loyalist Space Marine Chapters now in existence. 
 Guilliman is the primarch who took up the Emperor's burning blade and became the Lord Commander of the Imperium and the Imperial Regent, serving amongst the High Lords of Terra during the period of the reformation and reconstruction of the Imperium's administrative and military structure called the Time of Rebirth in the 31st Millennium. Guilliman single-handedly reshaped the Imperium after the Horus Heresy, taking the lead role in reforming its bureaucratic and military apparatus following the internment of the Emperor within the Golden Throne on Terra.
 Roboute Guilliman is also one of the few Loyalist primarchs still alive. Following the Great Scouring, Guilliman and his Ultramarines met the Emperor's Children Traitor Legion at the Battle of Thessala in 121.M31, where his corrupt brother Fulgrim mortally wounded him with a slice to the neck made by that Daemon Primarch's Chaos-tainted blades. 
 So it was that the dying Roboute Guilliman was put into temporal stasis on the verge of death and his body placed upon the throne that lay in the Temple of Correction on the Ultramarines' homeworld of Macragge. For the last ten standard millennia many pilgrims of the Imperial Cult travelled across the galaxy every standard year to visit the temple and see the body of a primarch, a blessed son of the God-Emperor Himself. 
 Some pilgrims claimed that the grievous wound was slowly healing, though such an action was physically impossible within an activated stasis field. The Avenging Son was silently enthroned through the millennia as his father's Imperium decayed around him, waiting until such a time when one could come with the power to restore him. And that time has come.
 The primarch was resurrected during the Ultramar Campaign of the 13th Black Crusade in 999.M41 by the technical prowess of Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Cawl and the power of the Aeldari god of the dead Ynnead through his priestess and instrument, Yvraine. 
 Soon after, Guilliman launched the Terran Crusade from Macragge through the growing Warp instability of the galaxy as the power of Chaos waxed mighty once more with the birth of the Great Rift. After nearly being imprisoned for eternity in the Maelstrom and then almost slain by his brother the Daemon Primarch Magnus the Red on Luna, Guilliman finally arrived at Holy Terra. 
 There, he entered the inner sanctum of the Imperial Palace and met with his father the Emperor for the first time in more than ten thousand standard years. What passed between father and son at that meeting is not known, but when he emerged, Guilliman announced that he was once more assuming the mantles of the Lord Commander of the Imperium and Imperial Regent, the first among equals on the Senatorum Imperialis and the de facto ruler of the Imperium.
 As the Great Rift's cataclysmic birth following the fall of Cadia disrupted interstellar travel and communications and the Noctis Aeterna closed like a shroud upon the galaxy, Guilliman moved swiftly to stabilise the faltering Imperium. He turned to Belisarius Cawl once more to complete a plan that had been over 10,000 standard years in the making, since the end of the Horus Heresy and Guilliman's last tenure as the Imperium's Lord Commander. 
 Cawl had spent that time ""perfecting"" the Emperor's original genetic template for the Space Marines laid down before the Great Crusade, creating a new legion of hundreds of thousands of improved Astartes deep beneath the surface of his forge-city on Mars. This new breed of transhuman warrior, the Primaris Space Marines, were bigger, more physically powerful and possessed faster reaction times than their original Astartes counterparts. 
 Cawl had also spent the intervening millennia pushing the very boundaries of Adeptus Mechanicus dogma in search of ""innovation"", creating new, more advanced power armour, wargear, and vehicles for the Primaris Marines.
 But before Guilliman could move to make use of his new armies, the Chaos God Khorne took advantage of the Noctis Aeterna to launch a Daemonic assault upon the Throneworld of Mankind, initiating the Battle of Lion's Gate. Though Guilliman led the Imperial defenders, including the newly re-vitalised Sisters of Silence and the Adeptus Custodes, in throwing back the howling servants of the Blood God, the brazen assault shocked the High Lords of Terra to the core. They realised that in this new age, no world was safe from the Ruinous Powers and the other foes of Mankind.
 In the wake of the Battle of Lion's Gate, Guilliman gathered the greatest fleet of Imperial warriors that had been seen since the Great Crusade. The largest component of this force included a massive new host of hundreds of thousands of Primaris Space Marines, divided half into new Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes and half into 9 Space Marine Legion-sized formations known as the Unnumbered Sons. 
 The primarch launched this massive Indomitus Crusade out into the void, determined to throw back the forces of Chaos and the xenos hordes wherever they threatened the worlds of Humanity. Guilliman's Fleet Primus set a winding course. Strike forces from over a dozen pre-existing Chapters of Space Marines, led by the Imperial Fists, also joined his fleet. Thus began many new legends as Guilliman travelled to aid beleaguered planets, breaking sieges and sweeping away Chaos and xenos invaders alike to bring hope back to the desperate defenders.
 The Indomitus Crusade would reach the end of its first major phase approximately twelve standard years later at the Battle of Raukos with the stabilisation of the Imperium Sanctus. Afterwards, Guilliman would turn his attention to helping his Realm of Ultramar defeat the forces of the Death Guard Traitor Legion and the servants of Nurgle in the Plague Wars, driving his traitorous brother Mortarion and the Death Guard from the region in ca. 012.M42 according to the Old Imperial Calendar. 
 Before the conflict had ended, Guilliman announced that he had made a grave mistake when he had allowed the official borders of Ultramar to shrink so drastically in the days after the Horus Heresy. Instead, he reestablished the ancient ruling Tetrarch Council for Ultramar, and tasked its newly-appointed Tetrarchs, including his Primaris Space Marine Equerry Captain Decimus Felix and the Ultramarines First Captain Severus Agemman, with beginning to expand the territories of Ultramar to include all of the star systems that had once comprised the Five Hundred Worlds.
 Thanks to the widely distributed efforts of numerous Imperial Iterators, the story of Primarch Roboute Guilliman, his early life and his rediscovery by the Imperium is widely known and well-accounted for, in stark contrast to certain others of the primarchs. Much of these accounts have of course served the role of edification for the masses and the demands of Imperial propaganda over the millennia, but between the accounts, variously embellished, a number of consistent facts and themes emerge.
 According to Imperial legend, the Emperor of Mankind created the twenty primarchs from artificially-engineered genes using His own genome as part of the original template, carefully imbuing each of them with unique, superhuman powers through the arcane arts of the Immaterium. Imperial doctrine goes on to tell how the Ruinous Powers of Chaos spirited away the primarchs within their gestation capsules, scattering them widely across the galaxy through the Warp.
 More than one of the capsules was breached whilst it drifted through Warpspace -- the forces of the Immaterium leaked in, wreaking havoc on the gestating superbeing that lay within the capsule. Undoubtedly damage was done and Chaos corruption affected several of the primarchs, although the nature of that corruption would not become apparent until the Horus Heresy.
 After drifting for solar decades, or in some cases even hundreds of Terran years, the twenty gestation capsules came to rest on Human-settled worlds throughout the Milky Way galaxy -- distant planets inhabited by a variety of Human cultures, and whether by fickle fate or cruel design, each world provided a crucible that tempered the superhuman child into the primarch they would become, be that hero or monster, tyrant or liberator.
 The capsule containing the developing form of one primarch fell upon the world of Macragge in the Eastern Fringe of the galaxy. Macragge was a bleak but not inhospitable world, part of a decayed star empire of ages past that Mankind had inhabited for many standard centuries since the time of the Dark Age of Technology. Its industries had survived the Age of Strife largely intact, and its people had retained an authoritarian but cohesive society.
 Macragge had remarkably preserved a number of antiquated, short-range, Warp-capable voidcraft which could be utilised for near-stellar transit -- conditions permitting -- and its people continued to build sub-light voidcraft even during the time of the most intense Warp storms that interfered with superluminal travel and communications during the Age of Strife. This had allowed the people of Macragge to maintain contact with several neighbouring Human-settled star systems, despite the Warp storms' fury, and so retain a tenuous link to the rest of Human space and the knowledge that it was not alone in the darkness.
 So it was that when the primarch's fallen capsule was discovered by a group of Macraggian magnates who were on a hunt in a local forest, they knew it immediately for a device of advanced technology rather than a thing of superstition and ""magic"". The magnates broke the capsule's seal and discovered a strikingly beautiful and perfectly formed Human child within it who was surrounded by a glowing nimbus of golden power. The child was brought before Konor Guilliman, one of a pair of nobles who bore the title ""consul"", and whose authority governed the most civilised and powerful region of Macragge surrouding the great city of Macragge Civitas. Konor adopted the strange infant as his own son in a manner not uncommon to his culture, naming him Roboute.
 The young primarch grew unnaturally quickly and as he did so, his unique physical and mental powers became obvious to all. It is recorded that by the time of his tenth birthday as measured in Terran years, Guilliman had mastered everything the wisest tutors of Macragge could teach him. His natural insight into matters of history, philosophy and science astonished his teachers, while his recall was absolute and his ability to extrapolate accurate conclusions from fragmentary information was said to border on the inexplicable.
 His greatest talent, however, lay in the art of war, which was itself treated as a high and lauded science in Macragge's culture. As soon as he had attained his legal majority, Roboute's foster-father Konor Guilliman immediately granted him command over an expeditionary force sent to pacify the far northern lands of Macragge. 
 Named Illyrium, it was a barbarous land of outcasts and petty, warring micro-states that had long harboured brigands and mercenaries who raided more civilised lands as often as they hired themselves as foot soldiers to fight their neighbours' wars. Roboute fought a brilliant campaign and won both the submission and the respect of the fierce Illyrium warrior bands, but when he returned to his home from the northern frontier, Roboute found the capital city of Macragge Civitas in turmoil.
 During Roboute's absence, Konor Guilliman's co-consul, a man named Gallan, had unleashed a coup d'etat against Konor -- a development far from unknown historically, if in this instance a surprise. Gallan, it transpired, had long harboured designs on undiluted rulership of Macragge Civitas and had conspired with those amongst the wealthy nobility of Macragge who were jealous of Konor's political power and popularity, and also increasingly afraid of his preternaturally precocious foster child's future.
 These malcontents represented Macragge's ancient regime, an aristocracy whose wealth was manifested by vast estates which were supported by the toiling of a multitude of impoverished serfs and vassals. Konor Guilliman, backed by Macragge's industrial magnates -- rivals to the old regime -- had moved to challenge this balance of power, forcing the aristocracy of Macragge to provide their vassals with increased living standards and rights before the law, weakening the aristocracy's stranglehold on the polity.
 Konor had also passed legislation that obliged the nobility of Macragge to begin an ambitious programme of improving the long-neglected infrastructure of their nation and enlarging the capital city at their own expense. These reforms made Konor Guilliman all but unassailable in the common people's eyes, but were highly unpopular among all but a few of the more far-sighted aristocrats.
 As Roboute Guilliman and his triumphant army approached the city of Macragge Civitas, they saw the smoke from a multitude of fires and encountered citizens fleeing from the city in anarchy, and Roboute learned that Gallan's private army had attacked the Senate House while Konor and his loyal honour guard troops had been inside. The refugees each told the same story; that rebel soldiers had attacked the Senate House of Macragge Civitas, whilst a drunken mob, instigated by Gallan but now out of anybody's control, roamed the city burning, looting and murdering.
 Roboute hurried to his foster father's rescue. Leaving his own troops to deal with the drunken rioters without quarter, Roboute personally fought his way towards the centre of the city, passing the bloody work of rebel firing squads everywhere in the government district, but at the Senate House, found himself too late. All was a bullet-ridden and blasted ruin, and even the rebels it seemed had fled the scene to join the looting. There, in the half-collapsed shelters beneath the building, he found his foster father dying.
 For three solar days the wounded consul had directed the defence of the besieged Senate House, even as surgeons fought for his life following a botched assassination attempt on the Senate floor which had touched off the conspiracy's chaotic attack. It is apocryphally said that as he gasped out his last breath, Konor Guilliman detailed the extent of Gallan's betrayal to his beloved foster son and named those whose hands were stained with his blood.
 Roboute Guilliman's cold rage at his foster father's treacherous death was unstoppable. With the full backing of his army and the beleaguered citizens of Macragge Civitas, Roboute crushed the aristocratic rebels, scattering their hireling armies and lined the streets with the hanging bodies of the rioters, thereby quickly restoring order to the world's capital city and the surrounding lands. Thousands of citizens flocked to the Senate House and amidst a wave of popular acclaim, Roboute assumed the mantle of the sole and now all-powerful Consul of Macragge.
 The new ruler broke what remained of the old, aristocratic order and stripped from them their lands and titles. Gallan and his fellow conspirators were seized, the ring leaders publicly executed and the rest sentenced to hard labour rebuilding the city they had ruined, stone by stone, by hand. It was not a sentence they would long survive. In the new order, loyal soldiers and hardworking settlers were granted rights where the oppressive aristocracy had once held sway.
 With superhuman energy and the singularity of vision only a primarch was capable of executing, the new consul reorganised the social order of Macragge, creating a ruthlessly enforced meritocracy where the hardworking prospered and the honourable received positions of high office, and those who shirked the law or worked against the good of the whole faced draconian, but faultlessly even-handed punishment.
 The stagnated and uneven economy was re-ordered, advanced technology predating the onset of the Age of Strife was disseminated rather than horded by the elite, and the planetary armed forces were transformed into a powerful and well-equipped force. Macragge flourished as never before -- one people and one order, united under the unchallengeable rule of Roboute Guilliman.
 Around the time that the young Roboute Guilliman waged war in Illyria, the Emperor's Principia Imperialis fleet of the Great Crusade had reached the planet of Espandor in ca. 832.M30 at the outer edge of the network of worlds with which Macragge had maintained tenebrous interstellar contact. From the Espandorians the Emperor learned of the existence of Macragge and the extraordinary son of Consul Konor Guilliman, and from what He learned He knew that this child could be none other than a missing primarch.
 There have been some who have suggested that the Emperor's arrival at Espandor and the isolated region of the Eastern Fringe of the galaxy so far from the frontline of the Great Crusade's main spur of progress was no accident, and that by some arts He had perceived or had foreknowledge of what He would find. Regardless, what followed was certainly not foreseen.
 As the Emperor's fleet quickly moved on to Macragge, it was almost immediately deflected by violent Warp squalls which had risen up to separate Macragge and a handful of nearby star systems from the expeditionary fleet's approach. Thwarted by a power even the Emperor could not readily ignore, it would be something in the region of five standard years before contact could be successfully attempted.
 In the years that intervened, Macragge had undergone a striking transformation. It was now a world of uniformity and order, prosperous and productive. Its cities had been rebuilt in glittering marble and shining steel, and the serried ranks of its armies were well-armed and well-equipped, and outfitting themselves now for operations beyond their own world.
 For even before the Emperor's arrival, Roboute Guilliman, it is said, had dwelt much on the ancient histories contained from his world's deposed aristocracy, and the fragments he found there telling of the ancient interstellar domains of Mankind during the Age of Technology, and he had begun to dream of new horizons and new worlds to conquer, of a domain ""beyond the seas of night"" or to use the ancient scholarly form found in the text -- ""Ultramar"".
 By his will, he made it so and within their Warp-sealed enclave, vessels from Macragge now plied regular and well-patrolled trade routes with the local star systems, bringing raw materials and people to the flourishing world, while against some of its neighbours, short, victorious conflicts had already been waged to pacify the strife they had found there.
 It is said that when the Emperor finally saw what His lost gene-son had wrought in 837.M30, He was indeed pleased, and that He met Roboute Guilliman without the dissembling that had been needed with those primarchs He had found of more savage timbre, such as Leman Russ, Ferrus Manus, Mortarion and Vulkan. It is further recorded that once Guilliman learned the truth of his origins, he immediately swore his fealty to the Emperor, who he knew was his true father, for he had already theorised correctly the purpose for which he had not been born so much as deliberately created.
 It was immediately apparent to Imperial observers that Roboute Guilliman possessed a powerful analytical intelligence, even when compared to the transhuman cognitive abilities of his primarch peers, as well as a talent for statecraft and macro-organisation of staggering potential. Yet few could then guess what such talents harnessed to the Great Crusade would go on to achieve.
 The XIII Legion of Space Marines, sometimes called the ""War-born"", was assigned to the command of Guilliman in short order, for the primarch needed little urging or aid in the assimilation of knowledge of the wider galaxy, the Great Crusade and the many technological wonders of the new-born Imperium of Man.
 It was a development greeted by the XIII Legion with great rejoicing and pride in the honour that Roboute Guilliman paid them in accepting their fealty. The oratory and vision with which their newfound primarch expounded to them his designs for the future and the righteousness of the Great Crusade filled the Legiones Astartes with a renewed vigour and dispelled any shadows of doubt in their minds, and made Guilliman's takeover of the Legion, according to official records, all but seamless.
 Roboute Guilliman did far more than merely take command of the XIII Legion, he set about transforming it. His vision was for a Legion that was more than simply one army among many, however exceptional, but a self-sustaining power for conquest, order and expansion; the strength of the body and blood of the Imperium made manifest by the will of the Emperor through His servant Roboute Guilliman.
 To Guilliman, a military force was more than the warriors who wielded arms -- it was their chain of supply, the starships which carried them between the worlds, the manufactoria which supplied their munitions and the inhabited colony planets that bred their recruits; they were indivisible and equally vital. To Guilliman's mind, all of these things made a Space Marine Legion, and he meant to control them all so that his own would prosper and the Emperor's will be done.
 In accordance with his grand design, he planned to not merely take the world of his fosterage as his headquarters and recruiting ground as his peers had done and would continue to do, but from the start set it up as merely the fulcrum of a far larger network of provender and support. The basis of this network would be the worlds Macragge had long maintained links with, but they would merely be its first components, not its fullest extent.
 This would be the start of Roboute Guilliman's ""Realm of Ultramar"" and it would be a project of solar decades in the making, and continue to expand right up to the first treacherous blow of the Horus Heresy.
 As swiftly as he put his plans for the creation of the Realm of Ultramar into action, Roboute Guilliman embarked on the root and branch reorganisation of his Legion. Adopting an extraordinarily detailed plan which drew from both the military doctrines and political philosophies of his surrogate homeworld of Macragge, a detailed study of the history of the XIII Legion and each and every other Legion and armed force under the Emperor's banner in their then-current form, he remade the organisational structure and tactical doctrines of his Legion accordingly.
 The result was an elegantly structured but elaborate and highly meritocratic force. It unsurprisingly built on much that had already been evident in the character of the XIII Legion, as their primarch's gene-seed had already partly shaped them, however unconsciously, and through the application of analysis and reason sought to purge any weaknesses or deficiencies to achieve the optimal military outcome.
 This, as with so much of the Legion's affairs, was considered by the primarch an ongoing project, and it evolved quickly into a dual doctrine which embraced in parallel on one hand what were the ancient and deterministic values of the warrior: courage, discipline, skill and adaptability, defined as that which was practical, and on the other: planning, precedent, analysis and assessment, defined as that which was theoretical. Both were of equal weight and value, one complementing and informing the other, blending together as the metals which made a fine blade. This became the Legion's doctrine and creed.
 As with the society Roboute Guilliman had built on Macragge, the XIII Legion under his mastery would be as ruthlessly even-handed as it was efficient, with the needs of the individual sublimated to the greater whole, but the life of the individual never spent wantonly or without purpose; for Guilliman's doctrine stated that each Legionary lost weakened those who remained.
 Within the Legion, the valour and the achievement of the individual were rewarded with honour and greater responsibility, but the obedience to hierarchy and order it demanded of its members was to be unquestioning and unchallenged. The outward signs of this transformation were striking.
 The livery of the XIII Legion was altered to a deep blue, chased with gold, while the symbol of the ancient ""Ultima"" glyph found in the pre-isolation stellar charts of the Ultramar region was adopted as its icon and seal to tie them to the newfound realm whose values they embodied. And with the new cognomen ""Ultramarines,"" perhaps as one work attributed to Remembrancer L. Amphidal suggested, ""Roboute Guilliman and his Legion would vow to take the Great Crusade beyond the stars themselves if needed to see its completion.""
 With its forward base relocated to Macragge, Roboute Guilliman was granted an independent crusade command for the region by the Emperor, and quickly set about a series of fresh conquests. His 12th Expeditionary Fleet reformed under his command and was supplied with warships of the latest designs from Mars as a special boon of the Emperor.
 Fresh conquests were immediate, as the newly named Ultramarines rapidly expanded their range out from Macragge, identifying suitable targets for Imperial Compliance and singling out hostile xenos holds for eradication. Interrupted only when called upon to join larger campaigns by the will of the Emperor, for nearly a Terran century the 12th Expeditionary Fleet ranged as far to the galactic north as the dead expanse where the Dominion of Storms ended and as far to the galactic east and south as the point of Ultima Thule, where the stars paled and emptied out into the limitless darkness of the exo-galactic void.
 During this period, the Ultramarines, by some records, succeeded in liberating more Human-settled worlds than any other single primarch's forces, and the planets Roboute Guilliman brought within the Imperium always benefitted from his intense passion for efficient and ordered government.
 Whenever Guilliman and the Ultramarines made a new world Compliant, his forces spent as much effort in establishing it afresh, setting up self-supporting defences, and ensuring that in his wake, the agents of the Imperial Truth and industry would firmly seal the world's place in the fabric of the Imperium. This spread of cohesive Imperial civilisation in the XIII Legion's path served both to solidify and expand supply lines for its advance, facilitating in no small part the great speed and range of the Ultramarines' conquests.
 As inexorably as its tally of victories multiplied, the Ultramarines Legion's numbers also began to grow. Even before its reunification with its primarch, the XIII Legion had been mindful of its losses and demonstrated its ability to expand steadily thanks to the resilience of its gene-seed during multi-generational, rapid replication. But with its primarch's vision to guide it, his organisational skill and his own unique genetic material now available to further strengthen and enhance the fidelity and purity of the Legion's gene-stocks, the resultant expansion was meteoric, perhaps beyond anyone's -- even the Emperor's -- expectations.
 Within solar months of the Ultramarines Legion's establishment on Macragge, the first influx of new recruits had arrived at the Fortress of Hera, the Legion's fortress-monastery and new headquarters, and the process of renewal and increase in the XIII Legion's fighting strength had begun and never since had ceased. Wave after wave of recruits were taken in and processed, not simply from Macragge and the surrounding Five Hundred Worlds of the slowly expanding Ultramar, as numerous as they were, but from scores of worlds and colony outposts where the conquering fleets of Roboute Guilliman had gone.
 The process was meritocratic and exacting; only the strongest and most able adolescent candidates were selected, chosen for both desired physical and mental attributes, but the net was flung so wide that the initiate intake dwarfed that of any other single Legion. This, coupled with the Ultramarines' resistance to what they saw as the ""waste"" of attrition warfare, created a kind of amplification effect in practice where the larger the Legion used in a single Imperial Compliance action, the more force was brought to bear and the fewer the casualties taken.
 Where this was not the case -- and there remained many hard battles fought by the Ultramarines against hideously powerful foes such as savage Ork empires, the Tanaril and other nightmarish xenoforms -- and heavy losses were inevitably suffered, the Legion's sheer size and its huge capacity to renew itself with more recruits offered it formidable resilience, and such losses were almost invariably replaced within a few Terran years.
 By the time Horus was appointed Warmaster over all the Space Marine Legions and other Imperial military forces at the Triumph of Ullanor, the Ultramarines were by any official assessment the largest single Space Marine Legion by number of Legionaries with a considerable margin. Owing to this expansion, the now massive 12th Expeditionary Fleet was sub-divided into a score of smaller expeditionary and persecution fleets, allowing the Legion to range further, each still numbering scores of vessels and thousands and sometimes tens of thousands of Legionaries.
 The numeric strength of the Ultramarines Legion, in excess of 250,000 Astartes before the Isstvan III Atrocity, would be an achievement that would not be surpassed, though in secrecy the late expansion of the traitorous Word Bearers, who originally numbered approximately 100,000 Astartes, would come to rival them by some assessments, while the wilder claims as to the strength of the Alpha Legion also have them run closer to the Ultramarines' strength than official records of the period would indicate.
 This scale of military force and the near-autonomous ""empire within an empire"" that maintained it -- as Ultramar had reached a size popularly ascribed as the ""Five Hundred Worlds"" before the outbreak of the galactic civil war -- would have dire and unforeseen consequences for the Ultramarines and their primarch.
 Separate and inviolate in the east, and a great power within their own right, the Legion's very existence made them a threat to the Traitors' conspiracy that could not be ignored, and on Calth would the Warmaster's plan and the Word Bearers' desire for revenge combine in an effort to see that threat destroyed.
 Since his takeover of the XIII Legion in the fourth solar decade of the Great Crusade after his rediscovery by the Emperor in 837.M30, Roboute Guilliman had succeeded in transforming the Ultramarines into an intricate and highly functioning weapon of war, and in doing so had built upon a track record of success in battle which held very few stains of defeat.
 For more than half a standard century the Legion had gone from strength to strength, waging Compliance actions and liberating Human-settled worlds for the Imperium across the eastern reaches of the galaxy, and forging the Realm of Ultramar in the process.
 Though not yet having reached the decisive numerical superiority of the other Space Marine Legions, it would manifest by the time of the Horus Heresy, yet the Ultramarines of 899.M30 were perhaps already on the cusp of becoming the largest Legion, as their ranks, then standing at around approximately 166,000 Legionaries, stood them in the forefront of their peers.
 The Dark Angels, who in the previous solar decade to this had been undoubtedly the most powerful single Legion, had fallen in number and evened this figure, having suffered massive casualties holding the line during the infamous Third Rangdan Xenocide. 50,000 Space Marines had spent their blood in preventing the destruction of perhaps the entire northern Imperium by that alien menace from the outer darkness.
 The Ultramarines in contrast had spent solar decades in building up their forces and expanding the frontiers in the galaxy's east, having had the advantage of their excellent network of supply and recruitment, and their primarch's formidable generalship was at a zenith of its strength thus far. Yet for all this, Roboute Guilliman knew that a shadow of doubt afflicted his Legion's soul. That doubt had its origins in its darkly storied defeat in the Osiris Cluster Rebellion a few short Terran years before the primarch's reunion with his Legion.
 Marius Gage's tenure in command as Legion Master had commenced with this disaster, and it became a baleful influence in the psyche of the Legion, a thing which while left unspoken nevertheless had power, and that even seemed to cast a pall over the Legion's recruits unborn when the battle was lost. The primarch knew that the only way to purge his Legion of this shadow of the mind was to find once more the xenos known as the ""Osirian Psybrids"", and with the Ultramarines at his back, destroy them utterly.
 To this end, ever since he had first reviewed reports of the action when he took over his Legion, Roboute Guilliman had begun planning the Psybrids' destruction, analysing and re-analysing every facet of the Legion's battle-logs, gun-picter footage and even the deep auspex data gathered from the aetheric cogitators of the warships that had survived for microscopic fluctuations.
 In the solar decades as his Legion had gone from Compliance to Compliance, war zone to war zone, the primarch had never stopped running continued theoretical battle scenarios against the macabre and powerful xenos, knowing that one day they would make their reappearance and that he and his Legion would be waiting. But solar decades passed and they did not return.
 There had been rumours of course, unsubstantiated accounts passed on from frontier Rogue Traders, intermittent reports of inexplicable massacres and mass disappearances, but the galaxy, even within the fold of the growing Imperium, was a strange and dangerous place, and the evidence was seldom conclusive as to the culprit, or pointed to the more commonplace but no less deadly privations of several known xenos species.
 Only at Maxilla Veritas near the Warp rift designated the Maelstrom, twenty-six standard years after the Osiris Rebellion, was the evidence for the Psybrids' involvement considered viable. But by the time fast cruisers from the Ultramarines fleet arrived, the trail was already long cold and the planet's death bore silent witness to the Psybrids' passing. It was in the closing segments of 899.M30 that conclusive word finally reached the Ultramarines primarch that the Psybrids had not only been encountered, but met in battle.
 Relayed from the central astrotelepathic chamber of Terra, the strange report had come from a sub-fleet of the XII Legion, then in its last days as the War Hounds before its own primarch, Angron, was found. The fleet, under the command of Praetor Erad Krüg, was fighting on the southwestern extreme of the Great Crusade's frontier near Eurydice Terminal. Here the War Hounds had been engaged in repelling an attack on the frontier outpost world by Ork void raiders from the self-styled ""Glortian Empire"" from the untracked abysses beyond.
 The War Hounds, though severely outnumbered, had held off the repeated Ork attacks through a series of savage voidship boarding actions in close orbit and high intensity assaults on their landing zones, preventing the green-skinned xenos from gaining a foothold on the ground. It had been during the latest of these assaults, the largest yet attempted by the Orks, that a mysterious third party had attacked both sides.
 When the Ultramarines retribution fleet arrived, not even the superhuman intellect of the Ultramarines primarch could have predicted what his Legion would find there. The entire system had been sundered into a battleground littered with burning debris and the radioactive echo of heavy weapons fire. The Ultramarines found the last surviving few hundred Legionaries of the XII Legion, the remnants of a force that had once been ten times its number, led by the terribly wounded but still commanding Erad Krüg.
 The War Hounds praetor detailed to Guilliman the story of a strange and terrible battle in which the Psybrids had managed through their mental powers to enslave a vast feral population of Orks to do battle for them against their own kind, and had sought to do the same to the Imperial defenders of Eurydice. Only the War Hounds had proved able to resist the creatures' baleful influence, but massively outnumbered they had paid for their resistance in blood, and would have been overwhelmed regardless if huge numbers of enraged Orks, seemingly the massed forces of the entire Greenskin Glortian Empire, had not swarmed into the system.
 During the ensuing battle, the Orks fought with unbelievable fury even given their warlike species' tendencies, compelled by their baleful and even more alien masters to exterminate their enemies. More of the gargantuan Psybrid hourglass voidships in turn had appeared to reinforce their fellows, and with them thousands of enslaved xenos warriors and voidships, few of which were known even to the lexicanic data cores of the Imperial warships.
 Eurydice Terminal had become a killing star; a vortex of destruction that was even now calling more armies to their deaths, and here the Ultramarines had come to restart the battle afresh. Guilliman, having apprised himself of the tactical situation, modified his battle plans accordingly and without pause put his strategy of attack into operation.
 Despite Erad Krüg's request for his surviving Legionaries to be lifted from their wrecked vessel and given a place in the line of battle, the War Hounds were denied; this would be a battle for the Ultramarines alone. It was to be a tactical operation more traditionally the specialty of other Space Marine Legions than the Ultramarines, but at which Guilliman's own warriors were still well-versed -- a full assault-strike voidship boarding assault.
 The primarch's plan of attack was a shockingly direct one. His fleet didn't pause for a long-range bombardment or present a broadside and pound the enemy at close quarters; instead, he ordered his Legion to conduct a full boarding strike without prelude. Guilliman drove the core of his fleet and with it nearly 100,000 Ultramarines into the heart of the enemy.
 It was not without irony that Roboute Guilliman records in his own testimony about the assault that he and his Legion were adverse to strategies which resulted in a heavy cost of Ultramarines' lives; this single action would dispel that myth and illustrate the truth that such tactics were often wasteful and unneeded by a skilled general, but when such sacrifice was the most efficient and indeed perhaps the only path to victory, he and his Legion would pay that price with fervour and unbreakable determination.
 The Ultramarines at last unleashed their wrath as they closed with the enemy vessels, hundreds of gunships and assault rams roaring from their flight bays to the attack as the Ultramarines fleet unleashed a cannonade of a thousand lance batteries and macrocannons. The Psybrid nomad-vessels lashed about them with frenzied whips of elemental energy, and all around them hulls burst and voidships burned, but it was too little against the unstoppable tide of ire which crashed against them.
 Through the maze-like networks of turning corridors like the innards of a great machine, the Ultramarines stormed with deadly intent, destroying as they went. Soon they encountered ghoulish, half-solid vapour forms, lean and gaunt without their exo-armour, who fought with the savagery of caged animals, burning bright with psychokinetic energy and striking out with mind-burning blasts of power, but for every Legionary who fell, a dozen pressed forward in their place and, one by one, the Psybrids began to be corralled, cornered and killed.
 Led by axe-and-shield-wielding Invictarii and moving bulwarks of Terminator Armour-clad Veterans, the Ultramarines pressed into the heart of the great vessels, mining the corridors and power junctions with Melta Bombs and atomantic implosion charges as they went. For the warriors of the XIII Legion were implacable, and in them had been woken a rarely displayed drive for vengeance against the Psybrids that could not be diverted nor denied.
 It was Roboute Guilliman himself who breached the innermost chamber of the largest of the hourglass ships to find the master of the Psybrids. It was a towering, multi-limbed gestalt-thing, thrice the primarch's own height, whose long, almost equine head screamed out shockwaves of ceramite-breaking force as its inner sanctum was invaded. But even as his own Terminator-armoured honour guard staggered and fell under the psychokinetic onslaught, the primarch, with his Chief Battle Psyker Aaroth Ptolemy beside him, charged.
 The Psybrid-king reared up above them, its clawed arms bearing strange weapons like the image of some forgotten devil-god of Old Night, but Guilliman with the strength and speed born of the Emperor's unmatched genetic arts struck, cleaving the creature limb from vaporous limb as Ptolemy fought it on the psychic plane with every ounce of power in his possession, sacrificing his life so that Guilliman would be defended from the nightmarishly powerful creature's psychic assault.
 The monster finally fell and the primarch of the Ultramarines enacted his Legion's vengeance, ripping the thing's glowing brain from its skull and crushing it under his heel. One by one the towering hourglass vessels of the Osirian Psybrids fell, either torn apart by explosive charges from within, or rent to flinders in the crossfire of the waiting Ultramarines' echelons as they tried to break free. There was no escape.
 As the Psybrids died, so too did their slave xenos armies still warring on the ground, and soon only the Glortian Orks, already mauled and all but exhausted, remained, and the Ultramarines made short work of driving them away once more into the outer darkness.
 The blood price of the battle had been high enough, several thousand Legionary casualties, and many among them veterans of his Legion's Terran roots, eager to be the first in battle in order to expunge the failing of the past. But it had been a price willingly paid for vengeance, and it would be a price and more that the Ultramarines Legion would willingly pay again in the future.
 When the Warmaster Horus turned his back on the Imperium, swore his allegiance to the Ruinous Powers of Chaos, and began the Horus Heresy, his first act before making his break with the Emperor of Mankind open was to lure away as many Loyalist Legions from Terra as possible. 
 Horus ordered Guilliman to lead an expeditionary fleet to the world of Calth in the Veridian System in the Realm of Ultramar to prepare for a campaign in the Eastern Fringes of the galaxy, where, Horus claimed, a great Ork WAAAGH! was massing. 
 Horus expected the Ultramarines to await the arrival of the Word Bearers who would join with the XIII Legion in prosecuting a campaign against the Ork menace. Unknown to Guilliman, the XVII Legion had long solar decadfes before turned Traitor in service to the Chaos Gods, and its primarch, Lorgar, gleefully accepted Horus' orders to close the trap on his Legion's long-hated rivals. 
 The Word Bearers' sudden surprise attack decimated Guilliman's Legion fleet, and the Ultramarines' ground troops quickly found themselves impossibly outnumbered by their former allies as the infamous Battle of Calth erupted. The Word Bearers slew their Loyalist foes in droves in the early stages of their surprise assault and pushed them back over huge stretches of territory. 
 The Traitors of the Word Bearers rejoiced at the terrible blows they were inflicting upon the Legion that had once aided the Emperor in humiliating them upon the world of Khur with the destruction of its capital city of Monarchia, the ""Perfect City"", four solar decades before the start of the Heresy when they had been taken to task by the Emperor for repeated violations of the atheistic philosophy known as the Imperial Truth. 
 Unknown to them, Guilliman's flagship, which had survived the initial Word Bearers' attack on the Ultramarines' fleet, effected emergency repairs and regrouped with the other surviving Ultramarine starships in space. Having taken stock of his remaining forces, Guilliman sent an immediate astropathic distress call to Macragge.
 The Loyalist Space Marines on Calth, Ultramarines all, had been forced into a fighting retreat, but soon occupied fortified positions. Many Ultramarines had been born on Calth, and proved more resolute than the Word Bearers anticipated. In space, Guilliman's vessels began hit-and-run attacks on their over-confident enemy. Guilliman assessed his ground troops' positions and broadcast clear, concise orders to each pocket of defence, coordinating them into a cohesive force. 
 One Ultramarine force led by Captain Ventanus led a breakout and retook Calth's Defence Laser silos, aiding the sorely-pressed Ultramarines fleet from the surface of Calth. Guilliman's depleted forces slowed the Word Bearers down long enough for the remainder of the Ultramarines Legion to arrive and rout the Traitor Marines from the system, though at a heavy cost. 
 The Word Bearers turned Calth's own orbital defence platforms on the Veridian star, stripping away the outer layers of its photosphere and destabilising it, ultimately rendering the surface of Calth uninhabitable. At the same time, the Word Bearers had used the battle taking place on Calth to summon a massive Warp storm called the Ruinstorm, that was intended to cut off Ultramar from the rest of the galaxy and prevent the Ultramarines from providing any reinforcements to Terra as Horus made his assault upon Humanity's homeworld. 
 The eruption of the Ruinstorm cut off Calth from the main body of the Ultramarines Legion and left those Astartes of the XIII Legion trapped on Calth locked in a brutal subterranean ""Underworld War"" with those Word Bearer units that had also been left behind when their Legion retreated from the Viridian System. 
 Yet Roboute Guilliman and a large portion of his Legion had remained off-world as a result of the Word Bearers' devious assault upon the Ultramarines fleet. Bloodied but unbowed, the Ultramarines received the orders of Malcador the Sigillite, the Emperor's Regent, while he was indisposed pursuing the secret Imperial Webway Project, and prepared to meet the needs of the Imperium's defence against the Traitor Legions as best they could.
 In his wrath at the outcome of the Battle of Calth, the Lord of Ultramar had gathered what vessels he could spare after Kor Phaeron's ambush at Calth, drawn additional numbers from the first Ultramarines relief fleet bound for Calth after the massacre above that world, and tracked Lorgar Aurelian directly through the use of the XIII Legion's own astropathic choirs. 
 In the wake of the Battle of Calth, the Word Bearers Legion, led by Lorgar, linked up with Angron and his World Eaters Legion to launch a Shadow Crusade against the Realm of Ultramar's Five Hundred Worlds in an attempt to spread the massive Warp storm known as the Ruinstorm that had been conjured by the Word Bearers' First Chaplain Erebus at Calth across the Eastern Fringe. This prodigious Warp storm would effectively split the galaxy in half and deny needed reinforcements to the Loyalists as Horus drove on Terra in an attempt to overthrow the Emperor of Mankind.
 The Shadow Crusade laid waste to 26 worlds until Guilliman's retribution fleet finally caught up to the Traitors upon Angron's homeworld of Nuceria, which the World Eaters Legion was preoccupied with wiping clean of all life in vengeance for the treatment the Nucerians had merited out a standard century before to Angron. 
 The XIII Legion warship Courage Above All, Guilliman's temporary flagship, broke Warp at the system's edge, at the head of a large void armada consisting of 41 vessels. The Ultramarines fleet looked wounded, cobbled together from separate, smaller expeditionary fleets. It was not a dedicated interdiction warfleet, but clearly a ragtag strike force, a lance thrust to the enemy's heart. Guilliman himself had done the best he could with limited resources. 
 The XIII Legion's cruisers and battleships ran abeam of the enemy fleet for repeated exchange of broadsides, offering targets too big and powerful to ignore, while the rest of the Ultramarines fleet used calculated lance strikes from safer range. The armada then divided its assault potential, doing its utmost to destroy Lorgar's flagship Fidelitas Lex, and attempted to take the World Eaters' flagship Conqueror in a boarding action.
 But the Ultramarines' warships not only fought a void war, they also attempted to take the fight to the surface of Nuceria, for this attack was personal. The Ultramarines had come for revenge against Lorgar and the Word Bearers, just as they had pursued Kor Phaeron all the way to the Maelstrom on the other side of Ultramar. 
 Several Ultramarines warships attempted to make a run on Nuceria, haemorrhaging Drop Pods, landers and gunships, forcing planetfall by any means necessary. The Ultramarines fleet swept over and against the Traitors like an insect horde. 
 But the tenacious commander of the Conqueror, Lotara Sarrin, put up a difficult fight and destroyed a number of Ultramarines vessels that attempted to make a run for the surface. Though the World Eaters' flagship transformed a number of the smaller warships into flaming wreckage, the Ultramarines eventually punched through her tenacious defence and managed to land troops on the surface of Nuceria.
 Meanwhile, the Fidelitas Lex was already a ruin, its armour pitted and cracked, its void shields a memory. The cathedrals and spinal fortresses barnacling along its back were gone, laid waste by the Ultramarines' incendiary rage. The XIII Legion's armada attacked in strafing runs and protracted exchanges of broadsides, trading fire with the superior warship and accepting their own casualties as the cost of bleeding the bigger vessel dry. 
 Each assault left the Fidelitas Lex weaker, firing fewer turrets and cannons, taking punishment on its increasingly fragile armour. But she fought on. Crawling with smaller ships, the Fidelitas Lex lashed back with its remaining macrocannons, rolling in the light of its own burning hull. Guilliman guided the battle from the command deck of Courage Above All, and had decided that the Fidelitas Lex would die first, killed in the death of a thousand cuts and swept from the game board, while the Conqueror would be boarded and killed from within. 
 In the course of the battle in Nucerian orbit, the Conqueror could not rise to its sister-ship's defence. Both Traitor Legion flagships fought alone, starved of support and suffering the endless attacks of the XIII Legion's ragged armada. Salvation pods streamed from the Lex Fidelitas' sides and underbelly, along with heavier Mechanicum craft and bulk landers. 
 With the Legionaries of the Word Bearers already on the surface, the ship's mortal Human population fled in the vessel's final solar minutes. And still the great vessel fought -- rolling, turning, raging. The Ultramarines cruisers that drifted past burned as badly as the warship they were killing. This void battle was a form of dirty fighting between warships, too close for the neat calculations of ranged battery fire. Instead, it was an up-close and personal slugfest.
 The Ultramarines battle barge Armsman intercepted the Conqueror and came abeam, launching assault carriers and boarding torpedoes. While the World Eaters' flagship was busy repelling boarders, a number of smaller XIII Legion vessels slipped past her defences and launched Drop Pods, gunships and troop carriers. 
 The first Drop Pods hammered home on the planet's surface. Sealed doors unlocked and the first Ultramarines poured forth, bolters raised, moving in perfect and well-trained unity. But the World Eaters were waiting for them. Those not lost to the Butcher's Nails at once had the presence of mind to note that these Ultramarines were not the pristine cobalt-blue warriors they had previously faced on the War World of Armatura. These Legionaries of the XIIIth wore cracked power armour, still scarred and burnwashed from some horrendous battle solar weeks or months before. These were hardened veterans of the Calth Atrocity. They burned with a cold intensity to carry out the vengeance in their hearts, and were intent on getting to grips with the Word Bearers.
 As was their way, the Ultramarines established footholds at defensible positions, clearing room for their reinforcements to land. For every position they held, another was overrun by the World Eaters in a storm of roaring axes, or lost to the Word Bearers' chanting, implacable advance. The XII Legion crashed against the XIIIth in rabid packs, showing why Imperial forces had feared to fight alongside them for many solar decades. 
 Uncontrolled, unbound, unrestrained, they butchered their way through Ultramarines strongpoints, enslaved to the joy of battle because of the Butcher's Nails cortical implants sandwiched within the meat of their minds. The XVII Legion also met their Loyalist cousins, replacing ferocity with spite and hate. The Ultramarines returned it in kind, hungry for vengeance against the vile Traitors who had defiled Calth and damaged its star. Word Bearers units marched, droning black hymns and chanting sermons from the Book of Lorgar, bearing corpse-strewn icons of befouled metal and bleached bones above their regiments.
 As the fighting raged, the burning shell of the Fidelitas Lex cut through the clouds into the planet's atmosphere, shuddering on its way east, rolling ever downwards, achingly slow for something of such scale. The weight of the Fidelitas Lex' massive plasma engines dragged the stern down first, colliding with the Nucerian ocean's surface far from shore. 
 In the meantime, the demigod in gold and blue had finally found the object of his obsession amidst the clamour of war. Guilliman confronted Lorgar, possessing the advantage of two weapons, but Lorgar's Crozius Arcanum gave him a reach his brother lacked. When they first met, there was no furious trading of frantic blows, nor were there any melodramatic speeches of vengeance avowed. The two primarchs came together once, Power Fist against War Maul, and backed away from the resulting flare of repelling energy fields. 
 Their warriors killed each other around them both, and neither primarch spared their gene-sons a glance. Lorgar flicked the clinging lightning from the head of his Crozius, shaking his head in slow denial. Both primarchs fought without heeding their warriors, their godlike movements an inconceivable blur to the Space Marines fighting around them. None had ever imagined the heroes of this new age would take the field against each other, nor could they have predicted the wellsprings of spite between them. 
 Guilliman confronted Lorgar for what his Legion had done across the Five Hundred Worlds of Ultramar. In his righteous anger the Ultramarines primarch struck Lorgar with one of his fists, battering the Word Bearers primarch's sternum. Lorgar repulsed him with a projected burst of telekinesis, weak and wavering, but enough to send his brother staggering. 
 The Crozius followed, its power field trailing lightning as Lorgar hammered it into the side of Guilliman's head with the force of a cannonball. Both primarchs faced each other beneath the grey sky, one bleeding internally, the other with half of his face lost to blood sheeting from a fractured skull.
 As the two primarchs were locked in their furious life-and-death struggle, they were oblivious to the destruction being wrought around them. Suddenly, Angron burst forth from the Ultramarines' ranks, his armour a shattered wreck, and both of his chainswords spat gobbets of ceramite armour plating and scarlet gore. Angron was plastered with the blood of the slain after solar hours in the crush of the front lines of intense combat. 
 On his chest hung a bandolier of skulls taken from the mass grave of his former fellow gladiators at Desh'elika Ridge. Blood painted them as surely as it marked Angron. Even through the constant pain generated by the Butcher's Nails, that simple fact pleased him. He wanted his deceased brothers and sisters to taste blood once more. He had carried them with him across Nuceria, letting their empty eyes witness the razing of his former, hated homeworld. The World Eater primarch launched himself at Guilliman with murderous hatred. The two primarchs fell into a seamless, roaring duel where Lorgar and Guilliman had abandoned theirs. Guilliman was forced back by the storm of Angron's blows.
 As the two primarchs fought, Guilliman landed a glancing strike, his fist pounding across Angron's breastplate. One of the skulls of Angron's fallen kinsmen that hung from the chain worn across his breastplate was partially shattered and scattered across the ground. Guilliman stepped back, his boot crushing the skull's remnants to powder. Angron saw it, and threw himself at his brother, his howl of wrath defying mortal origins, impossibly ripe in its anguish. Lorgar saw it, too. 
 The moment Guilliman's boot broke the skull, he felt the Warp boil behind the veil. The Bearer of the Word started chanting in a language never before spoken by any living being, his words in faultless harmony with Angron's cry of torment. Lorgar enacted his dark plan to save his brother's life from eventual consumption by the Butcher's Nails, summoning the Ruinstorm to the world of Nuceria, tearing the sky open and unleashing a crimson torrent, formed from the ghosts of a hundred murdered worlds, raining blood. 
 Guilliman had been holding his own against both Traitor primarchs, until Lorgar ceased his attack and started his achingly resonant chant. Angron and Roboute still fought, with the lord of the Ultramarines giving ground each time Angron landed a blow. Angron plunged his chainsword up under Guilliman's breastplate -- a shallow stab, but a telling one. The Ultramarines primarch crushed the impaling sword in one fist and staggered back, truly bleeding now.
 Despite the maelstrom of combat and sorcery raging around them, Angron still fought Guilliman, standing above the kneeling Ultramarine primarch. He had not even noticed the storm of blood streaming from the sky in a red torrent. Sparks sprayed from Guilliman's raised gauntlets as he struggled to ward off blow after blow. He was beaten and down. His wounds bled profusely, a palette of proud defeat. 
 Guilliman's warriors fought desperately to retrieve him. Fortunately they were granted a brief reprieve, as Lorgar's incantation suddenly locked up Angron's muscles, and began to transform the Red Angel into a new form as a Daemon Prince of Khorne. Guilliman took the opportunity to escape into his gene-sons' defiant phalanxes, retreating in enviable unity. 
 Lorgar saw the expression of disgusted awe on his brother's face as the wounded Ultramarine primarch stared at Angron's metamorphosis atop the mound of dead gene-sons from all three bloodlines of Space Marines. The XIII Legion continued to fire even in retreat, leaving the world of Nuceria battered and bloody. Their campaign against the two Traitor Legions was over...for now.
 Roboute Guilliman escaped from Nuceria, unable to face or even fully comprehend what both of his brothers had become through their corruption by the Ruinous Powers. 
 The World Eaters completed their purge of Nuceria until not one Human life remained on the benighted world. Angron, now the very embodiment of the Blood God's Eight-Fold Path, shook the dust of his hated homeworld from his feet and did not think of it again.
 As a result of being cut off from access to Terra and much of the rest of the galaxy by the vast, conjured Warp storm called the Ruinstorm that was created by the treacherous Word Bearers at the Battle of Calth, Guilliman feared that his father's great dream of Human unity was in danger. 
 With no way of knowing whether Terra was already under assault or the Emperor was even still alive, Guilliman moved to safeguard the ideals of the Great Crusade and the Master of Mankind by creating a second Human interstellar empire, the Imperium Secundus, as a contingency. It was an action he would later consider one of his greatest blunders.
 Many Loyalist Space Marines trapped behind the line of the Ruinstorm were brought to Macragge thanks to the activation of the ancient xenos device located on the Ultramarian world of Sotha known as the Pharos, which functioned much like the now-obscured Astronomican as a beacon in the Warp. 
 Guided by the Pharos' beacon, many Loyalist warships of the Shattered Legions and other Loyalist forces were able to make their way through the Immaterium to the Ultramarines' homeworld. Not wanting to appear vain and power-hungry like his brother Horus, Guilliman refused to declare himself the Emperor of Imperium Secundus, instead initially trying to convince his fellow primarch Lion El'Jonson, who had arrived at Macragge with his Dark Angels Legion, to take the position despite being distrustful of El'Jonson's motives. 
 While organising the creation of Imperium Secundus, Guilliman survived an assassination attempt by an Alpha Legion squad disguised as Aeonid Thiel and other Ultramarines. Later, when the Night Lords primarch Konrad Curze, who had secretly taken refuge on the Dark Angels' flagship Invincible Reason during the events of the Thramas Crusade, was let loose upon Macragge, Guilliman and the Lion battled the Night Lords primarch together but were led into a trap by the Night Haunter. 
 Instead of being cornered, Curze detonated charges and brought the entire structure into which the other primarchs had been lured down upon their heads. Guilliman and the Lion survived thanks only to the efforts of the Loyalist Iron Warrior Barabas Dantioch activating the Pharos, which teleported the pair to Sotha. 
 El'Jonson and Guilliman made their way back to Macragge, where the Blood Angels Legion had recently arrived in the wake of the horrors of the Signus Campaign. Guilliman decided to name the reluctant Sanguinius the Regent of Imperium Secundus, so none would hold the title of ""Emperor"".
 However, in the short history of the existence of Imperium Secundus, Guilliman frequently clashed with his distrustful and taciturn brother Lion El'Jonson over policy. Obsessed with hunting for Konrad Curze on Macragge, the Lion insisted that the Night Haunter was behind the rebellions which began to plague the Ultramarine homeworld and he demanded that martial law be instituted, which Guilliman strongly resisted. 
 After a suicide bombing struck an Astartes convoy on Macragge, the Dark Angels were deployed by the Lion to establish martial law without Guilliman's express permission. Guilliman and El'Jonson again disagreed over the rebellion that had broke out in the Illyrium region of Macragge, with the Dark Angels primarch wishing to unleash weapons of mass destruction in an attempt to flush the rebels out as he suspected Curze was hiding in the region. 
 When Guilliman again objected to such an indicriminate use of force that would take much innocent life, the Lion instead commanded a more conventional Space Marine assault on Illyrium, and Curze was finally captured. Again at Guilliman's insistence, the Night Haunter was given a public trial to account for his treason. 
 During the trial, Curze revealed that Lion El'Jonson had ordered secret orbital strikes against the Illyrian rebellion in express contravention of Guilliman's wishes. This revelation enraged the Dark Angels primarch and nearly led him to kill Curze in the midst of the trial. 
 Angered by their brother's duplicity and consistent disregard for Imperial principles, Guilliman and Sanguinius dismissed El'Jonson from Macragge and ordered the primarch and his Dark Angels to leave Imperium Secundus space, but repenting of his actions as he realised his zeal for the Emperor's cause was making him act like the Traitors, the Lion later requested that he become Curze's jailer instead, as the Night Haunter's life had been spared.
 Following the trial of Konrad Curze, Sanguinius, Lion El'Jonson and Guilliman all agreed that the establishment of the Imperium Secundus had been a mistake and its government should be disbanded. Instead, they agreed to try and breach the line of the Ruinstorm to reach Terra and aid the Emperor, who they had learned still lived, in the defence of Terra from Horus' inevitable assault.
 As they sought to navigate the Ruinstorm, the combined Loyalist fleet of Ultramarines, Dark Angels and Blood Angels came across a variety of horrors and word of an entity spreading destruction across the galaxy known as the ""Pilgrim"". During the voyage through the Ruinstorm, Guilliman's fleet was ambushed by Traitor forces at Anuari, where Guilliman survived an assassination attempt by the Word Bearers armed with the Chaos blades called the Athames. Believing he could study the weapons to gain a better understanding of Chaos and potentially use such knowledge against the Traitors, an early example of the much-maligned thinking that the Inquisition would later label ""Radicalism"",  Guilliman kept the blades in his flagship's vault. 
 During the Battle of Pyrrhan, Guilliman commanded the Ultramarines personally while Sanguinius received a precognitive vision and realised that the fleet needed to go where the Horus Heresy had truly first begun, the cursed world of Davin. Reluctantly, Guilliman and Lion El'Jonson agreed to trust in Sanguinius despite their skepticism of his vision, but both had thought they would simply destroy the world upon arriving. 
 After arriving in orbit of Davin, Sanguinius shocked El'Jonson by boarding the Dark Angels' flagship Invincible Reason and taking the captive Konrad Curze away with him. Sanguinius hoped to use Curze's known potent psychic precognitive abilities to determine what he was meant to do upon Davin. Sanguinius commanded a mass landing on the world, and the enraged El'Jonson nearly ordered that Davin be subjected to Exterminatus regardless of Sanguinius' presence on it. 
 Brought back to his senses before such a horrific betrayal could occur, a chastened El'Jonson explained to Guilliman that he believed something from the Warp was trying to influence and manipulate them into walking the path of damnation like Horus and the other Traitor primarchs. Convinced that his brother was correct, the Ultramarine primarch realised the source of the Chaos corruption in the Loyalists' ranks. Guilliman retreated to his vault, and crushed the captured Athames with his Power Fist even as he declared to the Dark Gods that he would not be tempted as Horus had.
 On the surface of Davin, Sanguinius was trapped within a Warp portal and did battle with the Daemon Madail while Guilliman and El'Jonson desperately tried to reach him. A vicious battle erupted both planetside on Davin and above it, in which Guilliman's acting flagship Samothrace was destroyed by the Daemonship Veritas Ferrum. 
 During the battle that erupted at Davin's Temple of the Serpent Lodge, the place where Horus had been corrupted by Chaos when his soul was taken into the Immaterium through the machinations of the Word Bearers' First Chaplain Erebus, Guilliman and El'Jonson finally managed to put aside their lingering enmity and fight together as brothers should, defeating a massive Daemon Engine known as a Soul Grinder. 
 Eventually, Sanguinius was able to escape from the Warp and the Space Marine forces evacuated the world to orbit. Davin was destroyed by Cyclonic Torpedoes, and with its physical anchor in realspace gone, the Daemonic fleet which had protected the world vanished back to the Realm of Chaos. 
 Left behind in the space where Davin had been, a breach in the Ruinstorm became visible to the combined Loyalist fleet. The path through led to Terra, but upon further study it became apparent that somehow Horus had foreseen that this route to the Throneworld would open and he had left behind a massive fleet of Traitor warships to prevent the passage of the Loyalist fleet through that route. 
 Guilliman and El'Jonson agreed that the Ultramarines and Dark Angels fleets would face the Traitors while Sanguinius and the Blood Angels used the space battle as a distraction to slip through the breach in the Ruinstorm and make directly for Terra, for that was their destiny as predicted by Sanguinius' visions of the future. Sanguinius had foreseen that if the Blood Angels did not make it to the Throneworld, the Traitors would claim final victory.
 The plan proved successful, and in the solar months that followed, the Ruinstorm began to dissipate, allowing easier travel through the Warp for the Loyalists. Guilliman gathered whatever Ultramarine forces he could and at last began to make his own way to Terra. 
 In his path lay a large defensive chain of hundreds of worlds garrisoned by the Iron Warriors. In a series of bitter engagements, both sides took heavy losses but the Ultramarines were able to maintain a slow and painful advance on the Throneworld.
 Ultimately, Guilliman was able to set a final course for Terra after clearing away the last of the Iron Warriors garrisons. Travelling at maximum speed, his Legion was only solar hours away when the final battle of the Siege of Terra began aboard the Warmaster Horus' flagship Vengeful Spirit.
 Thanks to the summoning of the Ruinstorm, the Traitors' delaying actions at the Battle of Calth,  the fighting of the Shadow Crusade, at the Second Battle of Davin and in the solar months afterwards against the Iron Warriors, there was little that Roboute Guilliman could do in support of his beloved father the Emperor during the crucial Siege of Terra. 
 As the long and bloody years of the Horus Heresy passed after the Drop Site Massacre, the Traitor Legions under the command of the Warmaster Horus finally closed on the homeworld of Mankind. They launched their great assault against the Imperial Palace in 014.M31 while they believed a good portion of the Loyalist Space Marine Legions remained occupied in other regions of the galaxy. 
 While the forces of Chaos came close to battering down the gates of the Palace, the Loyalists' stout defence managed to hold the line long enough for Loyalist reinforcements to drop from the Warp on the edges of the Sol System. Salvation was coming. 
 In orbit of Terra, Horus' allies delivered the fateful news to the Warmaster while he sat directing the final battle for the Inner Palace. The Ultramarines, Dark Angels and Space Wolves Legions were only solar hours away from reinforcing the Emperor and His Loyalist defenders. Horus knew that his gamble to seize the Throneworld rapidly before a war of grinding attrition could begin had failed. 
 What happened next is disputed by Imperial scholars. Some of the more mercifully inclined believe Horus purposely disabled his flagship's void shields because he experienced one last moment of regret for his great betrayal and was prepared to meet the Emperor's personal judgement, while some believe it was a personal challenge to the Emperor so that Horus could face him even without successfully battering down the gates of the Imperial Palace. 
 Nevertheless, Horus lowered the shields of his flagship -- the Gloriana-class Battleship Vengeful Spirit -- allowing the Emperor, His Custodians, the Blood Angels' primarch Sanguinius and a company of Imperial Fists to teleport aboard and ultimately slay the Warmaster, ending the Horus Heresy. Yet the Emperor was mortally wounded in the exchange and interred in the Golden Throne immediately afterwards by the primarch Rogal Dorn, leaving a dangerous void of political power and authority in the war-ravaged Imperium.
 Ultimately, Guilliman and the Ultramarines were able to set course for Holy Terra with the final dissipation of the Ruinstorm. Travelling at maximum speed through the Warp, his reinforcement fleet of over 3,200 capital ships was scant solar hours away as the Emperor battled Horus aboard the Vengeful Spirit. However, without the psychic beacon of the Astronomican to light the way as the Emperor's psychic faculties were otherwise engaged, Guilliman's force was marooned just out of Terra's reach as at conventional, sub-light speed it would take tens of thousands of standard years for them to eventually reach the Throneworld. 
 This situation only reversed when, thanks to the effort of the former Remembrancer Euphrati Keeler and her Emperor-worshipping faithful of the Lectitio Divinitatus cult, the Astronomican was reactivated by the psychic power of their collective faith and Guilliman arrived at Terra to drive back the remaining Traitor forces in the wake of Horus' defeat.
 When the Ultramarines finally arrived they found Terra, the Sol System and essentially much of the Imperium's heart in ruins. Guilliman steadfastly refused to allow the Imperium to fall, and began dispatching elements of his Legion to all corners of the galaxy to stem the tide of invasion and unrest as the other Loyalist forces recovered and rearmed for the campaigns of the Great Scouring against the remaining Traitors that lay ahead.
 The Loyalist Space Marine Legions had lost tens of thousands of troops during the often savage fighting of the Horus Heresy, and half of the original 18 Legions had sided with Horus and been corrupted by Chaos. As a result, the number of Astartes left to the Imperium after the end of the Heresy was very few, yet never were they more needed.
 The confusion and disorder following the end of the Horus Heresy and the Emperor's direct rule over Humanity had left the Imperium weak and vulnerable. Everywhere the enemies of Humanity prepared to attack. Many worlds remained in the vile grip of Chaos. 
 Into this breach stepped Roboute Guilliman and the Ultramarines. Always the largest of the Astartes Legions since the middle years of the Great Crusade following the losses the Dark Angels had suffered in the Rangdan Xenocides, the Ultramarines found themselves divided and dispatched all over the tottering Imperium in a desperate effort to stem the tide of invasion and unrest.
 Guilliman, ever the statesman, took over control of the Council of Terra, establishing the position and authority of the Lord Commander of the Imperium and taking Malcador the Sigillite's old role of the Imperial Regent upon himself. In this position, he guided the Imperium forward after the internment of the Emperor in the Golden Throne for over a Terran century, through the long hard days of the Great Scouring when the Imperium reclaimed and cleansed the worlds lost to the Traitors and reestablished Imperial rule across the galaxy. 
 It was the Ultramarines who successfully held the Imperium together during such a time of intense danger. Macragge was able to supply new recruits at such a rate that before long the Ultramarines alone accounted for more than half the total number of Space Marines, and few were the star systems where their heroism went unnoticed. Within only solar decades following Horus' death, order was restored to the Imperium. 
 After solar decades of intense fighting, stability once again allowed the Imperium to grow and progress. To prevent a single military commander from having as many transhuman Astartes at their command as Horus had as the Warmaster, Guilliman reformulated the sizes of all of the Loyalist Space Marine Legions into thousand-man Chapters, based upon the old Legion formation of the same name, breaking apart the 9 original Loyalist First Founding Legions into the much smaller Second Founding Chapters even as the Legiones Astartes became the less-intimidating, no no less powerful Adeptus Astartes. 
 Never again would one person, no matter how noble and unblemished their motives, wield the power of an entire Space Marine Legion. At the same time, Guilliman had been hard at work for solar decades on a new method for waging war that finally reached its fruition after the Horus Heresy. The rationale and proper organisation of Space Marine Chapters are the main topic in this masterwork of military strategy, the Codex Astartes. Its doctrines would reshape the future of all Space Marines and forevermore dictate the foundation for the Imperium's military strength and the ultimate survival of Mankind.
 The Second Founding of the Space Marines was decreed seven Terran years after the death of Horus and the end of his Heresy. Most of the old Loyalist Legions divided into fewer than 5 Successor Chapters, but the Ultramarines were divided many more times than that. 
 The exact number of Successor Chapters created from the Ultramarines in the Second Founding is uncertain: the number listed in the oldest copy of the Codex Astartes now extant gives the total as 23, but does not name them. With the Second Founding, the size of the Ultramarines force was much reduced. Most of the Space Marines left Macragge to establish new Chapters on homeworlds granted elsewhere. 
 The Ultramarines' fortress-monastery on Macragge, the Fortress of Hera, had been built to accommodate more than ten times as many Space Marines as now remained on their homeworld. As a result, its arsenals and weapon shops were partially dismantled and taken by the new Successor Chapters of the Ultramarines to found their own fortresses. The genetic banks of the Ultramarines, and the huge recruitment organisation, were similarly reduced. 
 As a result of the Second Founding, the Ultramarines' gene-seed became pre-eminent across the Imperium. The new Chapters created from the Ultramarines during the Second Founding are often referred to as the ""Primogenitors"", or ""first-born"". The lasting heritage of Guilliman for the Adeptus Astartes of every Chapter was not only genetic, but spiritual. 
 Even to this day, 10,000 standard years later, all the Primogenitor Chapters venerate Roboute Guilliman as their own founding father and patron, and hold the ruler of Ultramar and master of the Ultramarines Chapter, whoever he be, as the exemplar of all that it means to be a Space Marine. So did the Ultramarines rise to become preeminent amongst their brother Chapters.
 Roboute Guilliman continued to serve with the Ultramarines Chapter, leading them and the Imperium as a whole as its Lord Commander and Imperial Regent for a hundred standard years after the Second Founding. It was said that during those years, Guilliman led several incursions alongside his brother Loyalist primarchs against the remaining Chaos Space Marines and the pocket empires they retained control over in Imperial space. 
 During one such conflict on the world of Eskrador, Guilliman faced his former brother primarch Alpharius of the Alpha Legion. Due to the vanity of Alpharius, Guilliman utilised a surprise attack which struck at the heart of the Alpha Legion forces and managed to kill a Space Marine he believed to be Alpharius in a duel. 
 However, Guilliman and the Ultramarines were greatly mistaken in their belief that the snake would die without its head, as indeed, the Alpha Legion's symbol is a hydra, the multi-headed serpent. The Alpha Legion retained its coherency as a fighting force and managed to drive the Ultramarines back in repeated assaults, undaunted at the loss of their primarch. 
 Guilliman eventually was forced to pull his warriors back into orbit and bombard Eskrador from above, but the Alpha Legion would remain a stubborn and insidious threat to the Imperium for millennia to come.
 It was in this period, at an unknown point, that Guilliman first struck up a relationship with the Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Cawl, the only tech-priest of the Adeptus Mechanicus who professed  no fear of technological or scientific sins like ""innovation"". Guilliman charged Cawl, who had once worked alongside the Emperor Himself in the gene-labs of the Biotechnical Division on Terra, with two important tasks for the future -- developing a technological means to resurrect him from death should he fall and the development of the Primaris Space Marines, a new generation of transhuman warriors that could improve upon the Emperor's original design and learn from the failures of the Horus Heresy. Cawl would spend the next 10,000 standard years in pursuit of both of these charges.
 Guilliman met his seemingly final fate during the Battle of Thessala in 121.M31, when he was laid low by the Traitor Daemon Primarch Fulgrim of the Emperor's Children, who had become a Daemon Prince of Slaanesh. 
 During this encounter with his former brother, Fulgrim managed to fatally injure Guilliman in the neck with his poisonous blade (which was remarkably similar to the Anathame sword that was used by the Dark Apostle Erebus to fatally wound Horus on Davin's moon).
 Fatally poisoned by his one-time brother, Roboute was transported back to Macragge in a stasis field, and remained entombed in the field for the next 10,000 standard years, frozen in time. Although physically impossible within the null-time of a stasis field, it was believed by many Imperial Cult pilgrims to his shrine that his wounds were healing, and that one day he would awaken again when the Imperium needed him most. 
 The Shrine of Guilliman built to contain his body was one of the most holy places in the entire Imperium, and one which welcomed millions of pilgrims every standard year. It lay within the Temple of Correction, a vaulted sepulchre forming a small part of the Ultramarines' vast northern polar fortress on Macragge. 
 The temple was a miracle of construction and typical of the attention to detail to which the Ultramarines apply themselves. Its proportions defied the Human mind by the scope and grandeur of its design. The multi-coloured glass dome that formed the roof was the largest of its kind in the Human-settled galaxy. 
 Even the Techno-magi of the Adeptus Mechanicus came to marvel at the structure said to have been designed by Roboute Guilliman himself. According to the Ultramarines there was enough marble within the temple to build a mountain, and sufficient adamantium and shining plasteel to construct a sizable Imperial warfleet.
 Within this edifice was the great marble throne of Roboute Guilliman, and upon that throne sat a regal corpse. Though the best part of 10,000 standard years had passed since his near-death, the primarch's body was perfectly preserved. Even the mortal wounds made by Fulgrim's toxic blade were visible upon his throat. 
 Guilliman's mortal remains were preserved from the ravages of time by means of a stasis field that isolated the primarch from the entropic stream of normal four-dimensional space-time. Everything encompassed by the field was trapped in time and could neither change nor decay. There were some in these years, however, who claimed the primarch's wounds did change. They said that Guilliman's body was slowly recovering and that his wounds showed mysterious signs of healing. 
 Others denied the phenomena, and pointed out the sheer scientific impossibility of change within the stasis field. Yet enough believed the stories to come to Macragge and witness for themselves the miracle of the primarch, generation after generation.
 For 10,000 standard years the Emperor of Mankind has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Terra, His withered body little more than a husk of the great man that He once was. His grand vision, the Imperium of Man, endures -- yet it does not prosper, for it lingers under a pall of misery and persecution, suspicion and mistrust. It is assailed on all sides and from within by Heretics, witches and aliens, and only by the endless sacrifice of countless citizens does the Imperium continue to exist. 
 Yet now, in the 41st Millennium, the people of the Imperium face their greatest trial. Orks wreak havoc across the galaxy, the T'au Empire expands in the Eastern Fringe, the Tyranids send vast alien swarms from beyond the stars to consume all in their path, and the Necrons awaken to reclaim what was once theirs. And above all, more deadly than any other foe, the forces of Chaos chose this moment to begin their most concerted invasion of the Imperium. 
 Under the eye of the Chaos Lord Abaddon the Despoiler of the Black Legion and his 13th Black Crusade, countless worlds fell to darkness. Madness and heresy are rife and violent Warp storms tear great rents in the galaxy. Blind in their ignorance, the High Lords of Terra send billions to their deaths in a bid to save the tottering Imperium. 
 Yet it took the Aeldari, a more far-sighted people, to realise that what the Imperium needed now was a hero, a symbol of the Emperor's will made manifest. The Imperium needed a primarch.
 The full might of the 13th Black Crusade assailed the Fortress World of Cadia, which stood as the lone sentinel of the Cadian Gate, the only predictably stable way out of the Warp maelstrom known as the Eye of Terror. Though severely outnumbered and assailed on all sides, the Imperial defenders held their ground, mounting a valiant defence under the superlative leadership of the Lord Castellan of Cadia, Ursarkar E. Creed. 
 As the conflict became increasingly desperate, many heroes of the Imperium gathered on Cadia. Space Marines from multiple Chapters lent their strength to the defence, including the Black Templars of Marshal Marius Amalrich, and the Imperial Fists of Captain Tor Garadon, who brought their Chapter's great mobile star fort Phalanx into the war. 
 Saint Celestine, a Living Saint of the Adepta Sororitas, swept down upon Cadia in its darkest hour, her Emperor-granted miracles instilling faith in its ragged protectors. Inquisitor Katarinya Greyfax, long a prisoner in the infamous collection of the Necron Lord Trazyn the Infinite, was released from captivity by Trazyn to lend her prodigious will and talents once more to the Imperial cause. 
 Yet the key to Imperial victory upon Cadia was discovered by the ancient Martian Tech-priest, Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Cawl of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Urged on by the Harlequin Shadowseer Sylandri Veilwalker, he had unlocked the secrets of the Necron-built black pylons that studded the surface of Cadia and other worlds throughout the Cadian System. 
 Abaddon had long sought out these ancient and mysterious structures to destroy them during his many Black Crusades, which weakened the veil between reality and the Immaterium. In truth, Cawl had been en route to honour an ancient pact made with the Lord of Ultramar many Terran millennia ago, but on Cadia he saw a chance to reverse the Despoiler's work and perhaps close the Eye of Terror forever. But it was not to be.
 Though the servants of the Emperor fought with dogged determination and courage, Cawl's works were undone when the pylons were destroyed and Cadia was dealt a final death blow. Those few Imperial defenders that were left alive were forced to flee before the flood of the forces of Chaos that assailed the doomed world. As they did so a terrible Warp rift yawned in their wake as the Eye of Terror actually began to expand across the galaxy. 
 Yet there was still one chance of salvation that remained -- Cawl's ancient pact with Roboute Guilliman and the mysterious artefact that he transported within an armoured auto-reliquary. Declaring themselves the Celestinian Crusade in honour of the Living Saint who still lit their way through the darkness, the surviving warriors of the Imperium made for the Macragge System within the Realm of Ultrmar, with the forces of the Despoiler hot on their heels.
 At the same time, the Aeldari species had been rocked to its very foundation by a cosmic upheaval of great significance. Ynnead, the Aeldari god of the dead, had partially awoken in the æther and chosen a former Aeldari of Craftworld Biel-Tan to be his prophet. 
 Yvraine, the Daughter of Shades, had walked many Paths during her long life, from that of dancer to Warlock to Aspect Warrior. She eventually had become a famed Corsair leader until a mutiny forced her to flee into the Webway, where she ended up in the Dark City of Commorragh, the primary home of the Aeldari's fiendish Drukhari kindred. 
 Fighting as a gladiatrix in the Dark City's infamous Crucibael arena, she defeated many foes before having fallen to a priestess of Morai-Heg, however, while she lay between life and death, she was resurrected by the power of Ynnead and chosen to act as his prophet in the material realm. Her rebirth during this Night of Revelations caused a great Dysjunction within Commorragh, and the Dark City was beset by the Daemonic servants of Slaanesh. 
 Fleeing the Drukhari forces of the Dark City's Supreme Overlord, Asdrubael Vect, Yvraine, aided by the mysterious Drukhari warrior known as the Visarch, and followed by some of the Drukhari who believed in her cause, successfully brought word of the Whispering God's awakening to Craftworld Biel-Tan. While there, the craftworld underwent a swift and terrible cycle of death and rebirth during the Battle of Biel-Tan that brought the Yncarne, the Avatar of Ynnead, into being.
 Some amongst the Asuryani embraced Yvraine's belief that the cycle of death and rebirth would be their salvation, and became her followers, known as the Ynnari -- the Reborn. Others rejected this upstart god's teachings as arrogance and dangerous in the extreme. But Yvraine pressed on regardless, and departed Biel-Tan in search of the time-lost artefacts known as the Croneswords and formulated a desperate plan to turn back the waxing tides of Chaos.
 It was this mission that brought Yvraine through the Webway to the frozen moon of Klaisus in orbit of the Fortress World of Kasr Holn in the Cadia System, leading an army of her people from every one of the species' fractious kindreds who once more laid claim to the ancient name of ""Aeldari"". 
 They emerged from the moon's Webway gate just in time to rescue the Celestinian Crusade from their Chaos pursuers. Driving off the Heretic Astartes of the Black Legion, the Ynnari negotiated common cause with the Celestinians, agreeing to aid them in reaching the Realm of Ultramar. Thus, as Warp storms billowed and spread across the galaxy, the assembled pilgrims hastened through the Webway, bearing a thin sliver of hope between them.
 In what were believed to be the closing years of the 41st Millennium, the stellar realm of Ultramar came under sustained attack from myriad foes. Menacing shapes stirred in the intergalactic void, the Tyranids of Hive Fleet Leviathan drifting inexorably towards Roboute Guilliman's ancient realm. 
 The Arch-Arsonist of Charadon, one of the greatest Ork warlords in the galaxy, led a monstrous WAAAGH! from his anarchic domain with the intent of overrunning the Ultramarines' eastern defences. Yet the greatest threat of them all was that posed by the dark servants of Chaos.
 A vast horde of Traitors, Renegades, mutants and madmen fell upon Ultramar under the leadership of the foul Daemon Prince M'kar the Reborn. That invasion plunged dozens of planets into bloody battle, war raging from the worlds of Espandor and Tarentus to oceanic Talassar. Yet eventually, after long solar months of sorrow, bloodshed and loss, the Ultramarines prevailed. M'kar was defeated and his armies driven off, pursued to the stellar void beyond the bounds of Ultramar.
 So began a period of rebuilding and consolidation across Ultramar, as Marneus Calgar and his Ultramarines Chapter led their peoples' efforts to shore up the battered defences of their realm. It was a period of repose and recovery that was to be all too swiftly ended.
 In the days immediately after the Fall of Cadia at the climax of the 13th Black Crusade, Abaddon the Despoiler, Chaos Lord of the Black Legion, was informed by the Chaos Sorcerer Zaraphiston of a disturbing reality. The sorcerer had discovered through his Warp-scryings that the Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Cawl had escaped Cadia's destruction with a device in his possession that could turn the tide of the Long War in favour of the Imperium of Man. 
 The Despoiler also learned that Cawl was one of a number of survivors of Cadia, now calling themselves the Celestinian Crusade, who had escaped into the Webway with the aid of the Aeldari Ynnari and were making their way to Macragge, the homeworld of the Ultramarines Chapter. To neutralise the nascent threat to his coming triumph over the Corpse-Emperor, the Despoiler detached a portion of his Black Fleet and ordered a Chaos Space Marine invasion of the Realm of Ultramar as part of the 13th Black Crusade.
 So it was that Abaddon was able to muster a sizable force of warriors from the Black Legion, the Iron Warriors, the Night Lords and a number of other Traitor factions, and hurl them against the worlds of Ultramar. While some Heretic Astartes warbands struck at the outer star systems in an effort to tie up potential Loyalist reinforcements, the main Traitor horde rode the tempestuous currents of the Warp straight into the Macragge System itself. So began another desperate and bloody invasion of the Ultramarines' realm remembered as the Ultramar Campaign of the 13th Black Crusade.
 The Celestinian Crusade, named for Saint Celestine, the Living Saint who had come to aid the defenders of Cadia in their darkest hour, was led not only by its namesake but also by Archmagos Dominus Cawl, Marshal Marius Amalrich of the Black Templars, and Inquisitor Katarinya Greyfax of the Ordo Hereticus. These individuals, joined by the Ynnari's commanders Yvraine, the Daughter of Shades, and her war leader the Visarch, first stepped from the Webway and onto the soil of the Shrine World of Laphis in the Macragge System. 
 They were surprised to discover that they had set foot in a war zone, but they soon defeated the local Chaos forces that had been in the vicinity of the Webway portal. The Celestinians and their uneasy Aeldari allies defeated the Heldrakes besieging the local Ultramarines fortress and then convinced the skeptical Space Marines to grant them passage to Macragge, though Yvraine and the Visarch sent the majority of the Ynnari back into the Webway to carry out missions more pressing for their people.
 The Celestinians arrived at Macragge aboard an Ultramarines strike cruiser to discover that the capital world of Ultramar had come under a full-scale invasion by the forces of Chaos. While a massive battle raged in orbit between the Chaos and Loyalist fleets, on the ground the Fortress of Hera, the Ultramarines' fortress-monastery, was in danger of falling to the Archenemy. 
 Gaining an audience with Marneus Calgar, the Chapter Master of the Ultramarines and the Lord of Macragge, Belisarius Cawl revealed that he was over 10,000 standard years old and had known the Ultramarines' primarch Roboute Guilliman during the time of the Horus Heresy. 
 Cawl explained that he had been tasked by Guilliman with finding a way to restore the primarch to life even before his mortal wounding by the Daemon Primarch Fulgrim at the Battle of Thessala in the time after the Heresy. Within the auto-reliquary he had kept with him since before coming to Cadia, Cawl maintained a unique suit of Artificer Armour, the Armour of Fate, that could sustain the primarch's life functions, and the Emperor's Sword, a weapon in which was embedded a small portion of the Emperor's own psychic essence. 
 Though Calgar and his Chapter Council were wary of the Celestinians, especially because they had openly allied themselves with xenos, Chief Librarian Tigurius supported their story. He explained to Calgar that he had been having prophetic dreams and the arrival of the Celestinians was no coincidence. In fact, it might be the Ultramarines' only hope in the face of the Chaos onslaught. Calgar accepted this explanation, and allowed the Celestinians and the Ynnari into the Temple of Correction where Guilliman sat in stasis despite his reservations about the newcomers.
 While Cawl began his work on the time-frozen body of Guilliman, seated upon his throne in the temple, the Black Legion took notice of the activity and launched a massive assault upon the Temple of Corrections, fearful of what the Loyalists were attempting. The Celestinians, aided by the Ultramarines' officers and the 3rd Brotherhood of the Grey Knights led by Grand Master Aldrik Voldus who had come to Macragge to aid the defence, faced off against over a hundred Black Legionaries. 
 Yet, even as the Loyalists fought to give Cawl just one more solar second to complete his work, more Chaos forces poured into the shrine from above using Dreadclaw assault boats, and the defenders quickly found themselves overwhelmed.
 Only then, at the last, did Yvraine call upon the power of her patron deity, Ynnead, the partially awakened Aeldari god of the dead. The alien god's power over life and death combined with Cawl's arcane technology to heal the primarch's ancient mortal wound and awaken him from his ten-thousand-year slumber. 
 An awakened and enraged primarch proved more than the Chaos attackers were prepared to deal with. Guilliman shattered the attacking forces of Chaos and provided an extraordinary surge in morale for his Ultramarines and the other Loyalist forces. The Imperials quickly swept the Black Legion before them, breaking the back of the Chaos assault upon the Ultramarines' fortress-monastery. In that one moment of resurrection, the fate of Macragge and of all Ultramar was decided.
 In the wake of the battle in the Temple of Correction, Guilliman was crowned as the restored primarch of the Ultramarines Chapter and all of its Successor Chapters, and as the Lord Macragge and rightful ruler of Ultramar. Marneus Calgar happily ceded the role of Chapter leadership to his gene-father, while Guilliman declared that the political autonomy of all the worlds that had once belonged to the Realm of Ultramar and gone their separate ways in the millennia since the Horus Heresy was revoked. The Five Hundred Worlds would be resurrected just as assuredly as their ruler.
 Ultramar was to be restored to what it had been in the golden age of the Imperium, a miniature stellar empire comprising five hundred Human-settled worlds. Once in full control of the Loyalist forces on Macragge, the primarch's strategic genius was unleashed, and the forces of Chaos were driven off of Macragge and then from most of Ultramar within approximately seven solar months. At that time, Yvarine, the Visarch, and the remaining small force of Ynnari took their leave to pursue their own agenda, with the primarch's wary blessing -- and thanks.
 During this time, the primarch found himself suffering from a spiritual malaise, as he was forced to come to grips with the reality of the Imperium of Man in the 41st Millennium. Far from the golden rule of prosperity, scientific wonder and freedom promised by the Emperor during the Great Crusade, the Imperium in His absence had degenerated into a despotic, tyrannical regime defined by ignorance, fear and superstition. 
 At first despairing, Guilliman finally found hope for Humanity's future once more deep in his heart and declared that he must make his way from Macragge through the roiling tides of the Warp to Terra. There he would consult with his father, the Emperor, and determine what must be done to save the Imperium from the servants of the Dark Gods.
 And so began the fateful Terran Crusade.
 Gathering forces from all across the Imperium who were able to reach Macragge as the Warp grew ever more turbulent in the wake of the 13th Black Crusade, the primarch assembled a massive Imperial fleet to reach Terra, beginning what was later remembered as the Terran Crusade. 
 Leaving Macragge and Ultramar in the capable hands of Marneus Calgar, who was once more placed in overall command of the Ultramarines Chapter, Guilliman's crusade fleet was passing near the great Warp rift known as the Maelstrom when it was intercepted by a Chaos fleet led by the Daemon Primarch Magnus the Red and his Thousand Sons Traitor Legion. 
 Magnus had stirred himself from the Planet of the Sorcerers for the first time in standard millennia in recent days, to assault the Fenris System of his ancient foes the Space Wolves, and now to confront his former brother. The Thousand Sons primarch cast a potent sorcerous ritual that flung the Terran Crusade Fleet into the Maelstrom, with no apparent way for it to escape from the labyrinthine clutches of that wound in reality.
 With time in the Warp indeterminate, the Terran Crusade wandered from Daemon World to Daemon World within the Warp rift, taking steady casualties from the constant Daemonic assaults. All during this time Roboute Guilliman's guilt and frustration began to grow, weighing down his psyche as the Loyalists found it impossible to escape the Maelstrom's clutches. 
 But a beacon of hope came when on one such world Guilliman received a psychic message from the Asuryani Farseer Eldrad Ulthran, now an ally of the Ynnari, which laid out a series of landmarks for the Imperial fleet to follow to escape the Warp rift. But when the much-diminished crusade reached the starship graveyard which marked the passage back to realspace, it was met by another massive Chaos fleet, this time of the piratical Chaos Space Marines known as the Red Corsairs, led by the Lord of Change Kairos Fateweaver. 
 The Chaos forces assaulted every voidship in the Imperial fleet, and Kairos ultimately succeeded in defeating Guilliman by using his psychic powers to wrap the primarch in chains literally crafted from his own guilt. Threatening the immobilised primarch's life, the Greater Daemon forced the rest of the Imperial fleet to surrender.
 The Terran Crusade found itself in dire straits, brought by Fateweaver's command to a Blackstone Fortress hidden in the Maelstrom by the Red Corsairs, a secret gift from Abaddon the Despoiler. There the primarch and his remaining followers would have rotted for eternity were it not for intervention from an unexpected source -- the Aeldari Harlequins led by the Shadowseer Sylandri Veilwalker and Cypher, the mysterious Fallen Angel who was a sometimes enemy and sometimes ally of those loyal to the Emperor. 
 In return for a promise to bring the Fallen Angel before the Golden Throne, Cypher freed the primarch and his compatriots. With their starships lost to them, their crews sacrificed to the Ruinous Powers, Veilwalker offered another path to Terra -- through the Webway gate that lay at the heart of the massive xenos star fortress. 
 The Imperials forced their way deep into the interior of the Blackstone Fortress, defeating the sudden influx of Khornate and Tzeentchian Daemons that barred their way. The last hurdle was represented by the Bloodthirster Skarbrand the Exiled One who directly assaulted the primarch after slaying the heroic Emperor's Champion Marius Amalrich. Guilliman managed to defeat the Greater Daemon in hand-to-hand combat largely because of the wound that Amalrich's Black Sword had left in Skarbrand's fiery hide.
 With Skarbrand's fall, the Terran Crusade passed through the Webway towards Terra, only to discover that the Labyrinth Dimension was already haunted by Magnus the Red and the forces of the Thousand Sons. As Veilwalker explained that there had long existed a secret exit of the Webway on Luna, the moon of Terra, Guilliman realised that his Daemon brother had been waiting for them. As soon as they opened the Webway exit in the Sol System, the Thousand Sons would rush through behind them, unleashing a major Chaos invasion right on Terra's doorstep, allowing Magnus to gain the glory ahead of the Despoiler. 
 But with aid from the Harlequins and other Imperial forces such as the Sisters of Silence and the Imperial Fists, Guilliman and his Terran Crusade survivors managed to overwhelm the Thousand Sons and cast Magnus back through the Webway portal, permanently sealing it so that it could never be used again to threaten the Throneworld of the Imperium.
 At long last, Guilliman was escorted by the awed defenders of Terra to the Imperial Palace, where the survivors of the Celestinian and Terran Crusades at last went their separate ways. There, he finally met for one full solar day with his father, the Emperor of Mankind, for the first time in ten millennia.
 Roboute Guilliman stood before the Golden Throne and communed with the Emperor. Through their telepathic interaction, the primarch was disturbed by what had become of his father's mental state. He felt that the Emperor had lost all pretenses of Humanity and gave off an overwhelming sense of coldness.
 The Emperor greeted Guilliman with interest, but as a creator would a long-lost tool, not as a father would with his beloved son. Guilliman feared that the long centuries of suffering upon the Golden Throne had stripped away whatever warmth and Humanity the Emperor had once possessed. None know what was said between them, but when the primarch emerged from the Inner Palace, he declared that he was taking up the mantles of the Lord Commander of the Imperium and Imperial Regent once more. 
 Now the first among equals among the High Lords of Terra just as he had been after the Horus Heresy, Guilliman promised the people of the galaxy that he would assemble the greatest fleet and armies seen since the Great Crusade to take the fight to Chaos ... and revive the Emperor's lost dream of a better future for Humanity.
 The Era Indomitus had begun.
 For ten standard millennia, the Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Cawl had been working on a task set for him by Guilliman before the primarch was mortally wounded by the Daemon Primarch Fulgrim in the days after the Horus Heresy: a new legion of transhuman warriors. In the time after the Terran Crusade, though the Imperium was poised on the brink of annihilation at the hands of Chaos, Cawl's task was at last complete.
 The Primaris Space Marines are a new breed of transhuman warriors developed across the span of ten standard millennia by Cawl on Mars. Cawl used the genetic template of the original Space Marines created by the Emperor for His Great Crusade as the starting point for the development of the new Adeptus Astartes. The Primaris Space Marines are bigger, more physically powerful and possess faster reaction times than their original, Firstborn Astartes counterparts.
 The Primaris Marines are new heroes for this, the darkest age in the Imperium's history. These warriors were the next step in the evolution of the Emperor's Angels of Death, and were timely reinforcements for the Imperium's armies as their enemies closed in for the kill in the wake of Abaddon the Despoiler's 13th Black Crusade and the birth of the Great Rift dividing the Imperium in two.
 To aid them in battle, these gene-forged warriors were equipped with new arms and armour forged on Mars itself, such as the Mark X Tacticus Power Armour worn by the Primaris Space Marine Intercessors, which combined the most effective elements of ancestral Horus Heresy patterns of battle-plate with more recent developments in power armour technology; the Mark II Cawl Pattern Bolt Rifle, the archetypal firearm of the Adeptus Astartes, now re-engineered, re-crafted and perfected, and the new Redemptor Dreadnoughts.
 At the dawn of the Indomitus Crusade called by Guilliman to throw back the forces of Chaos, these phenomenal new warriors joined the Lord Commander of the Imperium as he fought to liberate the scattered bastions of the Imperium. Some, Guilliman forged into new Space Marine Chapters, whole brotherhoods comprised only of these Primaris Marines. Others he offered to the existing Space Marine Chapters as much needed reinforcements. Many Chapter Masters welcomed their Primaris brethren into their ranks, accepting the new warriors gladly. Others, though, viewed these new creations with suspicion or outright hostility, claiming that the Emperor's work should never have been meddled with by mere mortals.
 Though they are a step removed from their brothers, the Primaris Space Marines still bear the gene-seed of their primarchs, and some dissenting voices worry how this new type of warrior will react with the known genetic quirks and flaws of some of the more unusual Chapters, such as the Blood Angels and the Space Wolves.
 But before the crusade could begin, Guilliman was forced to defend the homeworld of Mankind for the second time from the forces of Chaos during the Battle of Lion's Gate. As the first Warp storms of the Noctis Aeterna broke over Holy Terra in the wake of the Great Rift's birth, cutting off the Imperium from the beacon of the Emperor's Astronomican, its pollution-filled skies turned a roiling crimson. 
 Khorne, heedless of the plans of his brother Chaos Gods and hungry to prove his superiority, sent forth eighty-eight cohorts of his Daemonic Blood Legions to assault the Imperial Palace. The Blood God wanted the glory of tearing down the Golden Throne for himself, and so the skies of Terra congealed into bloodclouds that deployed the Red Host directly before the Lion's Gate of the Outer Palace.
 The gun batteries of the Imperial Palace are second to none, yet they alone could not halt this red tide. Led personally by Roboute Guilliman, the Primaris Space Marines, Adeptus Custodes and Sisters of Silence fought side by side. Although the rash Chaos assault was turned back and broken long before it could reach the Eternity Gate to the Inner Palace, the High Lords of Terra were shaken at the boldness of the foe. 
 Without the psychic beacon of the Astronomican, the Imperial Palace's arcane machinery and protective devices were not enough to halt the fell powers from materialising even on Holy Terra. Khorne, upon receiving the returning forms of his slain Daemons, grew so apoplectic in his rage that his fortress in the Realm of Chaos trembled. So great was the heat from his outburst of frustrated anger that the essences of the eight Bloodthirsters that led the failed attack were wholly obliterated.
 After his defence of Holy Terra, Roboute Guilliman gathered a new armada that he named the Indomitus Crusade, the largest concentration of Imperial military forces seen since the original Great Crusade over ten thousand standard years before. 
 Along with elements of the Adeptus Custodes, a small contingent of the Silent Sisterhood, and a vast war host of Primaris Space Marines from many newly founded Chapters and the 9 Legions of the Unnumbered Sons, the primarch's Fleet Primus set a winding course. Strike forces from over a dozen pre-existing Chapters of Space Marines, led by the Imperial Fists, joined the fleet.
 Thus began many new legends as Guilliman travelled to aid beleaguered planets, breaking sieges and sweeping away Chaos and xenos invaders alike to bring hope back to the desperate defenders. Among the many worlds aided by the Indomitus Crusade was Baal, the homeworld of the Blood Angels Chapter, which had come under assault by Hive Fleet Leviathan. During the so-called Devastation of Baal, the fleet of the crusade arrived in orbit of Baal after the Warp storms had already consumed the bulk of the hive fleet. 
 The Imperial reinforcements aided the Blood Angels in cleansing Baal of all remaining trace of the xenos infestation before helping them rebuild, for the strength of the Blood Angels and their Successor Chapters among the Sanguinary Brotherhood were sorely needed elsewhere in the beleaguered Imperium. Guilliman named Commander Dante, the Chapter Master of the Blood Angels, as the lord regent of the Imperium Nihilus, the half of the Imperium where the Astronomican no longer shone in the wake of the Noctis Aeterna. Dante was ordered to reclaim the worlds of this so-called ""Dark Imperium"" in the name of the Emperor.
 It was not long before word began to spread, as all those planets that could still receive astropathic messages hailed the return of a hero out of Imperial myth. Once more, one of the demigods of the past fought for the Imperium. The Indomitus Crusade's first phase reached its end some twelve standard years later at the Battle of Raukos, when Guilliman at the Triumph of Raukos declared the Imperium Sanctus, the half of the Imperium where the beacon of the Astronomican had been reestablished, finally stabilised from imminent collapse. 
 Afterwards, Guilliman would turn his attention to helping his Realm of Ultramar defeat the forces of the Death Guard Traitor Legion and the Daemonic servants of Nurgle in the Plague Wars.
 After the birth of the Great Rift at the climax of the 13th Black Crusade fractured the Imperium of Man in half at the dawn of the Era Indomitus, Ultramar came under assault by the servants of the Plague God Nurgle, who had decided to add the whole of Ultramar to his foul garden in the Realm of Chaos. 
 Three star systems to the galactic north of Ultramar, the so-called Scourge Stars, were corrupted by the influence of Nurgle and its planets were transformed into staging grounds for the invasion of Guilliman's stellar empire. The worlds of Ultramar were attacked from within and without by Nurgle's forces, including an invasion led by the Daemon Primarch Mortarion and his Death Guard Traitor Legion and the Daemonic Plague Legions of Ku'Gath, a Great Unclean One. 
 These so-called ""Plague Wars"" lasted for several standard years, until following the end of the Indomitus Crusade's first major phase at the Battle of Raukos in ca. 012.M42, Roboute Guilliman, now the ruling Lord Commander of the Imperium and Imperial Regent, finally arrived with reinforcements to aid his beleaguered home.
 Mortarion's already large invasion force, bolstered by mutants and Nurglite Chaos Cultists from the Scourge Stars, was accompanied by the Chaos Lord Typhus and his Plague Fleet alongside the Great Unclean One named Ku'Gath who led a host of 7 Greater Daemons of Nurgle called the ""Plague Guard"". Their strategy concentrated on taking and holding a few of Ultramar's major worlds such as Iax, Espandor and Konor. The Nurglites only launched smaller raids on the more minor worlds of the sub-sector, always withdrawing before any Ultramarines Astartes were deployed.
 The Espandor System was the first to come under siege. All the worlds in the system other than Espandor itself fell to the forces of Chaos; the Ultramarines bitterly contested Espandor Prime until they were later relieved. One of the Greater Daemons of the Plague Guard, Qaramas, led this attack, and his partial conquest of the Espandor System prepared the way for the rest of the Nurglite invasion fleet to surge into Ultramar.
 Iax was overrun by the Daemons of Nurgle led by Ku'Gath as the bulk of the invasion force came to bear upon it. It had been converted into a so-called ""Hospital World"" earlier in the conflict to deal with the spread of Nurgle's pathogenic ""gifts"" across the sub-sector and was therefore susceptible to infiltration by the heralds of Nurgle despite its stringent quarantine measures. Iax would serve as the base of operations for the Nurglite conquest of Ultramar as Mortarion, the Death Guard and the rest of the Daemonic Plague Guard ultimately concentrated their forces there late in the conflict.
 Macragge suffered from bouts of Chaos-induced unrest as Mortarion led probing attacks on the Ultramarines' homeworld. While this did not lead to any widespread destruction or damage to critical facilities or infrastructure, these incidents caused a drop in civilian morale and forced the Ultramarines' Chapter Master Marneus Calgar to waste precious time and resources on peacekeeping missions and displays of force to shore up the morale and confidence of Maccrage's suffering civilians.
 Typhus and his Plague Fleet overran and captured one of Ultramar's star forts. He was later directed by Mortarion to attack the Ultramarines training world of Parmenio.
 The Forge World of Konor came under assault by the forces of the Death Guard, their objective to conquer the crucial system and use it as a springboard for a final attack on Macragge itself. Worse, hordes of opportunistic Orks had descended upon the stricken Forge World, seeking to strip as much scrap metal and fuel as possible from Konor's vast reserves. These violent looters were equally dangerous to the forces of the Imperium and the Chaos invaders alike, as they rampaged across Konor in their smoke-spewing war machines, hacking and bludgeoning to death any unfortunate enough to cross their path. After many solar days of bloody fighting, the Imperium regained control of Konor. Though victory on Konor came at a heavy cost, a sizeable percentage of its precious production capability remained operational. Within solar hours of the battle's end, the Forge World's recaptured manufactoria and assembly halls were sanctified with machine blessings and reactivated, and began to churn out vital equipment and machinery for the escalating war effort across Ultramar.
 After the Battle of Raukos had ended the first phase of the Indomitus Crusade with the stabilisation of the defences of the Imperium Sanctus, Guilliman announced his intention to return to his home realm with thousands of Primaris Space Marine reinforcements and drive back the Chaos assault. First, he cleansed the Hive World of Ardium in the Macragge System of its Death Guard occupiers. In the course of that operation the primarch learned that Mortarion was using the ancient artefact known as the Hand of Darkness to craft arcane machines called ""Plague Engines"" that were re-animating the dead and turning them into Plague Zombies and Pox Walkers. Guilliman destroyed the Plague Engine on Ardium and freed the world from the influence of Nurgle.
 Guilliman's next destination was Maccrage itself, his ancient homeworld. He and his Astartes reinforcements, including the Primaris Marines, brought much-needed relief to the weary populace and their defenders. Arriving on Maccrage, Guilliman announced that he had made a grave mistake when he had allowed the official borders of Ultramar to shrink so drastically in the days after the Horus Heresy because of his belief that the Space Marines should not rule over large swathes of Mankind. 
 Instead, he reestablished the ancient ruling Tetrarch Council for Ultramar, and tasked its newly-appointed four Tetrarchs, including his Primaris Space Marine equerry Captain Decimus Felix and the Ultramarines First Captain Severus Agemman, with beginning to expand the territories of Ultramar to include all of the star systems that had once comprised the Five Hundred Worlds.
 After taking stock of the dire situation, Guilliman reorganised the Ultramarines and their mortal auxilia and launched a large-scale counterattack against the invaders. Several Ultramarines Successor Chapters also joined the fight at their primarch's behest, their Chapter fleets engaging the Death Guard and doing their best to keep Ultramar's shipping lanes and supply lines to the broader Imperium safe and secure.
 Guilliman first set his eyes on the Espandor System as part of what he named his ""Spear of Espandor"" campaign, because it served as the main supply line for the Death Guard invasion from the Scourge Stars. He retook each of the lost worlds in the system and destroyed the Plague Engines that were raising the endless tide of Plague Zombies and Pox Walkers on each of its worlds. 
 After a ferocious battle in which the Ultramarines Chapter found itself fighting side-by-side with their Primaris Marine brethren for the first time, the forces of Nurgle were routed from Espandor. Guilliman decisively ended the battle by slaying the Great Unclean One Qaramas with the Emperor's Sword and destroying the last Plague Engine in the system. The Espandor System had been cleansed of the taint of the Plague God and the forces of Nurgle were now cut off from their base in the Scourge Stars.
 With their supply lines to the Scourge Stars cut, their Plague Engines disappearing and slowly eliminating the constant tide of undead reinforcements, and new Imperial reinforcements pouring into Ultramar with each passing solar day, Mortarion found himself on the wrong side of what had become a war of attrition. 
 Guilliman had successfully cut the Death Guard off from resupply and would now proceed to cut their forces to pieces, one system at a time. With this in mind, Mortarion decided to throw all his remaining forces at a single target in the hopes of reversing the tide. Maccrage was still too heavily defended for the forces of Nurgle to carry out a successful assault, so Mortarion decided that the Plague God's Daemonic and mortal servants would target the Ultramarines training world of Parmenio. This battle saw the biggest armoured clash between the Chaos and Imperial forces during the war. 
 The largest star fort in Ultramar, Galatan, attempted to provide support to the Loyalist forces on Parmenio but was engaged by Typhus' Plague Fleet and was boarded by a contingent of Traitor Marines, leading to the death of the Novamarines' Chapter Master Bardan Dovaro in the vicious fighting.  On the surface of Parmenio, however, the Ultramarines slowly gained the upper hand. Guilliman killed Ku'Gath's lieutenant, Septicus, and shattered his Daemonic Plague Guard, an action that finally gave the Emperor's servants the upper hand in the conflict. With the campaign at last in hand, Guilliman turned to the hunt for his traitorous brother.
 Guilliman finally led an Ultramarine relief force to benighted Iax. Having discovered that Mortarion had not led the Nurglite forces on either Parmenio or Espandor, the Lord Commander of the Imperium was determined to hunt down his hated brother once and for all. 
 The Plague Wars came to their dramatic conclusion on Iax. Guilliman learned of the plot being enacted there by Mortarion and Ku'gath through interviewing a captured Daemonhost, much to the objection of his Tetrarch Decimus Felix, his Craftworld Aeldari liaison Illiyanne Natasé, and the Grey Knights. Despite knowing he was walking into a trap, Guilliman decided to nonetheless confront Mortarion on Iax. 
 The climactic battle of the conflict was fought on Iax, where Guilliman and Mortarion personally fought each other to a brutal stalemate amongst the ruins of the Hospital World. Guilliman was able to hold his own for a time, but was eventually defeated by the Daemon Primarch's Warp-enhanced might and resilience, as he had earlier been defeated by Fulgrim and Magnus the Red since their ascension to Daemonhood. With Guilliman disabled, Mortarion infected him with the deadly, supernatural Chaos-infused phage known as the Godblight which was capable of overwhelming Guilliman's augmented immune system and killing even a primarch. Guilliman remained defiant as he succumbed to the disease, refusing Mortarion's goading to call upon Nurgle and pledge himself to the Plague God as the Death Lord once had himself during the Horus Heresy in order to end the excruciating pain of the infection. 
 Seemingly claimed by death, as his soul hung in the balance between realspace and the Immaterium, Guilliman experienced a surreal vision of his reunion with the Emperor upon his prior return to Terra. The vision made clear that not even Guilliman truly knew what had transpired in the Throneroom of the Imperial Palace that day save that the Emperor had actually come to full consciousness for the first time in many standard millennia. 
 In the course of the vision, the Emperor made contact with the soul of His gene-son and His immense psychic power flowed into Guilliman, burning the Nurglish Godblight phage from his system and allowing the primarch to spring back to life, causing a shocked Mortarion to flee before the sheer purifying power of his gene-father. 
 Channeling the power of the conscious Emperor directly as the Master of Mankind's psychic conduit, Guilliman raised the Emperor's Sword and unleashed a psychic attack that reached into the Realm of Chaos through the connection created by the Godblight virus and burned the Garden of Nurgle itself. This assault was powerful enough to psychically incinerate a portion of the Land of the Plaguelord and even wound the Warp entity that was Nurgle personally. After unleashing the Emperor's assault, the primarch fell into unconsciousness, exhausted by his ordeal.
 In the wake of this battle, as the Nurglite forces in Ultramar continued to lose ground on every front, Mortarion and the Death Guard were summoned back to the Scourge Stars. Nurgle's outpost in realspace had come under assault from the forces of Khorne in what would become the War in the Rift, another campaign in the endless Great Game between the Ruinous Powers as they maneuvered for advantage against each other. 
 The Death Guard withdrew from Iax under the cover of a Virus Bomb attack on the Imperial forces and Nurgle's remaining servants ultimately retreated from Ultramar, but the threat of a renewed attack from the Scourge Stars was now a persistent threat to Guilliman's home realm.
 Guilliman's soul returned to realspace on Iax, where he explained the reawakening of the Emperor and the nature of his victory over Mortarion and Nurgle himself to Maldovar Colquan, a Custodian Tribune of the Adeptus Custodes who served with the Loyalists in Ultramar. The primarch later met aboard the Imperial fleet in orbit of Iax with the suffering Militant-Apostolic Mathieu to thank him for the crucial part he had played in the victory on Iax. 
 During the campaign Mathieu commanded an army of the Ecclesiarchy's Frateris Militia, spreading word of both the Emperor and Guilliman's divinity in defiance of the Imperial Regent's wishes to honour the ancient atheistic doctrine of the Imperial Truth. During the final battle on Iax, Mathieu took part in the assault to capture the portion of the metaphysical psychic construct known as the Cauldron of Nurgle held by the Great Unclean One Ku'gath in realspace. Mathieu's intense faith transformed him into a Living Saint for a time, channeling the power of his faith in the Emperor to shield Imperial forces from the corrupting Warp energies of the Plaguelord before destroying the cauldron himself, though at the price of his own life. 
 Meeting with the primarch for the final time, the priest of the Adeptus Ministorum informed Guilliman that the Emperor's consciousness was reawakening and preparing to return to full mortal life. Mathieu died shortly after, his body drained of its lifeforce by his ordeal, but Guilliman assured the memory of the dead priest that Mathieu's tale of heroism would be told to his successor.
 Surprisingly, Guilliman, who had always adhered rigidly to the Imperial Truth following his resurrection, also decided that should his newly chosen Militant-Apostolic choose to do so, he would not dissuade them from canonising Mathieu as an Imperial Saint. In truth, the events of the Plague Wars led Guilliman to question his former atheism and the purely materialist foundation of the Imperial Truth. Guilliman began to probe the artificially-intelligent Cawl Inferior construct given to him by Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Cawl for the meaning and nature of the Emperor's return to consciousness and the Master of Mankind's divinity. 
 After the victory on Iax, Guilliman decided to take his forces and leave the Imperium Sanctus now that it had been stabilised by the Indomitus Crusade. He intended to journey into the Imperium Nihilus to shore up its faltering defences.
 As originally chronicled in the Dark Imperium  novel series by Guy Haley published in 2017-2018 early in the 8th Edition of Warhammer 40,000, the Indomitus Crusade lasted for roughly 100 standard years and ended with the Plague Wars. 
 However in 2021 Black Library retconned the events of the novels to take place only 12 standard years after the crusade had begun, now with no end date for the conflict.
 This change now places the events of the Plague Wars in circa 012.M42 early in the Indomitus Crusade by the chronology of the original Imperial Calendar.
"
Abaddon the Despoiler,"Abaddon, also known as ""Abaddon the Despoiler,"" once named Ezekyle Abaddon, whose preferred title is ""Warmaster of the Imperium Nihilus,"" and is sometimes called by others the ""Warmaster of Chaos,"" is a Chaos Lord and the greatest Champion of Chaos Undivided in the galaxy. 
 Abaddon is the master of the Black Legion of Chaos Space Marines and is rumoured to be the clone-progeny of the Warmaster Horus, the greatest Traitor in Imperial history, and at one time his most favoured son as the first captain of the Sons of Horus Legion.
 Abaddon is now infamous for leading Black Crusades, the terrible military campaigns during which the normally fractious forces of Chaos unite under his leadership and launch a massive attack against the Imperium from within the Eye of Terror. 
 What few realised at the time was that these campaigns were part of an overall strategic plan called the ""Crimson Path"" intended to lead the forces of Chaos from the Eye of Terror all the way to Holy Terra itself, which reached its fruition in the final days of the 41st Millennium. Abaddon intends to succeed where his predecessor Horus failed, breaking the Imperial Palace wide open and tearing the Emperor's rotting corpse from the Golden Throne. 
 Over the millennia, each of his conquests and Black Crusades has gradually paved the way from the Eye of Terror towards the Sol System, despite this grand design often being oblivious to the Imperium's defenders. Less obvious, however, is that along that path, his actions have gradually weakened the veil between realspace and the Warp, assisting the birth of the Great Rift after the successful conquest of the Fortress World of Cadia during the 13th Black Crusade in ca. 999.M41. The birth of the Great Rift divided the galaxy in half and marked the start of the Noctis Aeterna and the Era Indomitus.
 The name of Abaddon, the Warmaster of Chaos, has become a bitter curse within the Imperium. During the Great Crusade, Abaddon rose to become first captain of the 1st Company of what was then called the Luna Wolves Legion. When the Horus Heresy came to a head, it was clear that Abaddon's loyalty lay with his primarch rather than the Emperor. He led the Terminators of the re-named Sons of Horus across Isstvan III, Isstvan V, Yarant, and Terra itself. Abaddon's anguish at his master's death at the hands of the Emperor drove him deeper into madness and hatred than any mortal should ever sink. 
 Before retreating, Abaddon took up the Warmaster Horus' body and fought his way out of the quickly deteriorating battle before the Imperial Palace. With their cadaverous prize, the Sons of Horus Legion fled before the Emperor's victorious armies.
 When Abaddon returned, it was at the head of a diabolic horde ravaging star systems around the Eye of Terror. His Heretic Astartes, now called the Black Legion, were at the forefront of the attack, destroying all in their path. During this 1st Black Crusade, Abaddon formed many bloody pacts with the Chaos Gods.
 Below the Tower of Silence, he recovered the Daemon Sword Drach'nyen, a weapon of prodigious power, making him nigh unstoppable. Since then, Abaddon has dreamed of forging an empire of Chaos upon the ruins of the Imperium. Twelve more Black Crusades have followed, each achieving some dark purpose that even the mightiest sages of the Imperium cannot discern.
 It is said that Abaddon alone has the power to unite the ever-fractious Traitor Legions and finish the treachery begun ten thousand standard years ago, ripping the Emperor from His place on the Golden Throne and at last claiming the galaxy for the Ruinous Powers.
 Abaddon was long reluctant to take up the title of ""Warmaster,"" not wishing to be associated with the failures of Horus. Horus' failure to achieve victory in the Horus Heresy left a deep mark upon Abaddon. He came to despise his gene-sire, and resolved neither to venerate Horus' memory nor to emulate him in any way. So, for the longest time, did Abaddon refuse to use Horus' title of Warmaster as he believed it to be tainted by his gene-father's failure and weakness. 
 However, with the success of the 13th Black Crusade and the Fall of Cadia, Abaddon at last considered the time right to resurrect the honorific and make it his own. Yet, in Abaddon's conception, no longer would the Warmaster be the great general and champion of the Dark Gods, ruling nothing he had not bargained for with inhuman entities. Instead, Abaddon declared his title to be ""Warmaster of the Imperium Nihilus,"" master of the sundered half of Humanity's realm that was, he said, far more territory than Horus ever conquered and held.
 Abaddon has now accepted the once-scorned title, for with the opening of the Great Rift, he feels that final victory in the Long War against the Emperor is at hand.
 In the days of hope that preceded the Horus Heresy, Ezekyle Abaddon fought amongst that most noble of brotherhoods, the Legiones Astartes. Originally the firstborn son of the most mighty of Cthonia's gang warlords, Ezekyle killed his father in single combat after a disastrous Cthonian coming of age ritual.
 Though he lived in exile after that point, his massive build and natural ferocity saw him grow to be a legend amongst his people. Before long, the vicious young warrior came to the attention of the Luna Wolves Space Marine Legion, and he was recruited into their brotherhood. Within the space of a few short years Abaddon had distinguished himself on the training grounds and fought his way through the echelons of the Luna Wolves to be given the newly founded rank of First Captain.
 After the development of new and powerful war-technology by the Mechanicum, Abaddon was gifted a suit of custom-made Cataphractii Pattern Terminator Armour to accommodate his mighty stature. So powerful a warrior had Abaddon become that he was used as a military model for the entire brotherhood of the Luna Wolves' elite 1st Company, known as the Justaerin.
 With a long history of victories behind him, Abaddon was soon respected as a leader and fighter alike, for he waged war like the warrior kings of old. Better yet, he earned a place at the right hand of Horus Lupercal, most favoured of all the primarchs. He became a lord of the new superhuman elite who were to redefine the course of human history; at first to the betterment of the Imperium of Man, and later to its tragic downfall.
 By the time of the Great Crusade, Ezekyle Abaddon had been recognised as the greatest warrior of the vaunted XVIth Legion after their Primarch Horus. He was blessed with being able to serve at the right hand of the Primarch himself, for to witness such a being in the flesh was to be in the presence of a demigod. Abbadon was the first and most respected of them all, a man who worshipped his Primarch as a god, just as Horus worshipped his father the Emperor of Mankind in turn.
 Horus Lupercal was raised up by the Emperor Himself as the greatest of all the Primarchs' number, an accolade never surpassed before or since. Yet amongst Horus' many virtues was his humility. He listened well to the counsel of his warriors, learned from his mistakes, and considered every action before committing to it.
 Amongst his advisers in the Luna Wolves, he trusted four officers above all. This council of warrior captains was known as the Mournival. At the time of the Horus Heresy's beginnings it was comprised of Abaddon himself, Tarik Torgaddon, Captain of the 2nd Company, Horus ""Little Horus"" Aximand, Captain of the 5th Company and Garviel Loken, Captain of the 10th Company.
 It was after the battle for the world designated Sixty-Three Nineteen by the XVI Legion, in which Tenth Captain Garviel Loken managed to reach and slay the impostor Emperor who ruled the world ahead of Abaddon, that the First Captain recommended Loken's elevation into the Mournival to replace the 4th Company's Captain Hastur Sejanus. Sejanus, a particular favorite of Horus, had been slain shortly before the battle.
 As the Great Crusade conquered its way across the stars, it reunited many of the scattered domains of Mankind that had been abandoned and isolated by the chaotic tides of the Warp. Always at the fore was Horus Lupercal, with Abaddon at his side. They were the first into battle, the first to exhort their brother Legions to acts of greatness, and the first to encounter the strange new threats that had grown in the dark corners of the galaxy.
 One of these threats was a danger so insidious that it slowly corrupted many of the Legiones Astartes, including the Primarch Horus himself. Abaddon was also a member of the Legion's Warrior Lodge, the ""quiet order"" within the Luna Wolves, inspired by similar lodges on the Feral World of Davin -- which the Luna Wolves had brought to Imperial Compliance many years earlier.
 Erebus, first amongst the Chaplains of the Word Bearers Legion and first amongst the worshippers of the Chaos Gods, had spread his secret warrior lodges to the brethren of the Luna Wolves as well as many of the other Space Marine Legions at the behest of his corrupted Primarch Lorgar in the decades before the Heresy began. In the daylight hours, those of the Legiones Astartes who had secretly come to worship Chaos used their twisted logics to sway more of their number to their cause.
 During one particular Imperial Compliance action, Abaddon notably stood against Horus' attempts to negotiate with a stray branch of humanity known as the Interex, preferring to adhere to the Emperor's stated policy, and simply demand surrender or force Imperial Compliance upon newly discovered human cultures. This attitude was reversed in desperation after Horus was critically injured by the Chaos-corrupted Imperial Planetary Governor Eugen Temba upon the XVI Legion's return to the world of Davin.
 Horus was mortally wounded after slaying the Nurgle-corrupted Temba upon the bridge of his downed starship on Davin's moon, which had been transformed by Nurgle's corruption into a reeking swamp infested with undead Plague Zombies, Temba's own former Imperial Army garrison. Temba had wielded a blade dedicated to Nurgle known as the Kinebrach Anathame that had infected the Primarch with a toxin so virulent that even a Primarch's superhuman immune system and all the advanced technologies of his Legion's Apothecaries could not defeat it.
 Blinded by grief, Abaddon and his fellow company captains took the Primarch's body on the advice of the Word Bearers' First Chaplain Erebus to a mystic healer who belonged to the Chaos Temple of the Serpent Lodge on Davin and who was actually a Chaos Sorcerer -- an act in utter contradiction of the Imperial Truth (which was stridently atheistic) and which opened Horus up to the influence of the Ruinous Powers of Chaos.
 Yet instead of salvation, the priests of that Davinite moon brought eternal damnation. When Horus emerged, a change had been wrought in him, and a shadow lurked behind his eyes that would never leave. The seed of bitterness that had been planted in Horus’ heart ultimately blossomed into a fullscale heresy that nearly tore the Imperium apart.
 Following Horus' corruption by Chaos and his resurrection through its profane power, Abaddon backed his Primarch to the hilt and firmly aligned himself with Horus against the Emperor, ultimately giving his soul over completely to the service of Chaos Undivided. Horus, under the guise of putting down the religious rebellion against Imperial Compliance on the world of Istvaan III, amassed his troops in the Istvaan System.
 The corrupted Warmaster had a plan by which he would destroy all the remaining Loyalist elements of the Legions under his command, a plan that would ultimately unfold into the nightmare of what Imperial scholars would later name the Istvaan III Atrocity. During the resulting campaign of attrition, Abaddon was responsible for the wounding and abandonment of the Loyalist Captain Garviel Loken within the ruins of the Istvaanian capital known as the Choral City, although Loken survived the combat and witnessed the beginning of the orbital bombardment of the planet and the remaining Loyalist Astartes on it by the Traitor Legions' fleet on Horus' orders.
 Throughout the seven brutal standard years of the terrible Imperial civil war that was the Horus Heresy, First Captain Abaddon led the elite squad of the renamed Sons of Horus Space Marines from the 1st Company known as the Justaerin, who wore singular black-coloured Cataphractii Pattern Terminator Armour. Abaddon led this elite unit during many of the most infamous actions by the forces of Chaos during the Horus Heresy, including the Drop Site Massacre on Istvaan V, the battle against the Loyalists on Yarant as well as in the climactic Battle of Terra.
 Yet the Warmaster fell at the last. As he duelled his once-beloved gene-father, the Emperor, upon the bridge of the Vengeful Spirit, Horus' flagship, the Warmaster was vanquished by a psychic blast. Abaddon and his most heavily-armed warriors fought their way through squad after squad of yellow-armoured Imperial Fists Terminators to the command centre of the starship, but they were too late.
 Running across iron decks that were slick with the blood of demigods, Abaddon took up the lifeless body of his father with great tenderness. Wracked with emotion, Abaddon detached the taloned claw that Horus had used to kill the PrimarchSanguinius from his Primarch's armour and resolved to use it to one day throttle the Emperor Himself.
 With his gene-father dead, Abaddon abandoned the conquest of Terra and instead retreated with the Sons of Horus Legion and all of their remaining assets, Legion slaves and starships, blazing a trail across the stars to the forbidden realm of the Eye of Terror. The Traitor Legions retreated in his wake, cursing the hour that had stolen their destiny. With this act, Abaddon passed from mortal space and into legend.
 Following the dire events of the Horus Heresy during the final epic Battle of Terra and the death of the Warmaster Horus aboard his flagship, the Vengeful Spirit, First Captain Abaddon and the surviving Sons of Horus broke orbit over Terra and fought their way free of the battle and escaped into the void. A time of reprisal and retribution known as the Great Scouring followed, and countless worlds were put to death by the Loyalists for siding with Horus, their corpses left as a warning to others. Those Traitor Legions that remained in the Imperium were hunted mercilessly and hounded across the stars by pitiless Loyalists. Abaddon and the remaining Sons of Horus took refuge in the Eye of Terror, choosing to plunge into that maelstrom of madness rather than face extinction at the hands of the Emperor's vengeful warriors.
 The Sons of Horus managed to reach the Eye of Terror with the bloodied survivors of the Scouring, but the once mighty XVI Legion was reduced to a fraction of its former size. Led by only a few remaining captains, the Legion struggled with its loyalty to their fallen Primarch and the cold reality of their defeat at the hands of the Emperor and His lackeys. Bereft of their glorious Primarch, the Legion floundered, and in desperation turned to each of the Chaos Gods in turn in their search for renewed power, inviting daemonic possession and the ever more costly blessings of the Warp. All the while, the Legion suffered the jealous attacks of their former allies. As the Traitor Legions turned upon one another, the Dark Gods subverted and manipulated their new playthings, reshaping the Legions for their own ends and the never-ending war between the gods.
 Ezekyle Abaddon abandoned the Legion; broken by the death of Horus and sick of war, he wandered alone into the Eye of Terror. Taking his Legion's massive flagship, the Vengeful Spirit, Abaddon left his brothers behind and plummeted into the furthest reaches of the Eye. The former First Captain knew theLegion Wars would never end. These were not his battles. Shedding blood for slaves and territory -- Abaddon wasn't a barbarian, to fight over trivial nothingness. He was a soldier, a warrior. If the Nine Legions wished to raid one another's hunting grounds for table scraps and steal each others' toys, then he would let them. Of his own Legion, he felt no need to save them from their petty fate. They chose to fight and die in a worthless war. Abaddon's Dark Pilgrimage took him across the thousands of worlds of the Eye. He walked the surface of every world in their purgatorial prison. He felt that he had to -- to learn the realm's boundaries, to see its secrets. Abaddon would not mourn a Legion he had left behind. His time as a pilgrim layered wisdom and perspective atop the brutality of his former command.
 Meanwhile, the Sons of Horus carried the body of their Primarch, preserved in stasis, further into the Eye, ignoring the wars that raged around them. On the Daemon World of Maeleum, a graveyard world of steel and rust, the Sons of Horus raised a fortress, fashioning a mighty citadel from the wrecks of decaying vessels lost to the Warp with the aid of the thousands of slaves they had taken from the worlds of the Imperium. The Legion interred Horus' body within a great tomb, where many fell into worship of their fallen demigod. Lupercalios, the Monument, was a mausoleum to the XVIth Legion as much as a stronghold. It was where the body of their Primarch had been interred after the Terran Breaking. Few of the other Legion were permitted anywhere near the Sons' last bastion. It also served as a fortress from which they would launch further attacks upon both the Imperium and their fellow Traitor Legions. All the while, the XVIth Legion suffered the jealous attacks of their former allies amongst the forces of Chaos as the brief unity between the Dark Gods and their servants during the Heresy once more broke down into the normal state of internecine rivalry, unleashing the Slave Wars.
 With their Primarch dead and their Legion on the verge of extinction, the Sons of Horus stagnated. Some captains suspected that it would be but a matter of time before they and their Battle-Brothers were drawn into the wars between the Traitor Legions, and so they pushed for the Sons of Horus to replace its losses by increasing the Legion's gene-seed stocks. These same captains knew that any fortress, no matter how grand, could not hope to hold back a determined Space Marine assault, and called for more warriors to be found. Unfortunately, the majority of surviving captains were convinced that the Warp would provide all the power they needed, if only they could master the methods of merging daemon and Space Marine.
 The wars between the other Legions who had sided with Horus during the Horus Heresy raged across the Eye of Terror even as the Sons of Horus ignored the events happening around them, and continued to raise their fortress ever higher, worshipping the corpse of their Primarch. The Sons of Horus had remained largely apart from these conflicts; however, jealous eyes now turned their way. Traitorous forces gathered against them and conspired to rob them of the remains of Horus to further vile and selfish ambitions. The Primarch Horus' body, with its potent genetic information and biological secrets, was a great prize indeed. In a sudden assault, the remnants of the debased Emperor's Children, having grown vastly in power after firmly cementing their terrible pacts with Slaanesh, easily smashed their way through the defences of Maeleum and into the central chambers of the Sons of Horus' stronghold. They stole the body of the slain Primarch from the heart of its tomb and spirited it away, some say with the purpose of handing it over to the dark Apothecary Fabius Bile who intended to clone it in order to create a new and still greater Warmaster of Chaos to restore the Traitor Legions' unity and fortunes.
 Following the sundering of the XVIth Legion and the destruction of Lupercalios, Falkus Kibre, Chieftain of the Duraga kal Esmejhak warband, master of the warship Baleful Eye, and former commander of the Justaerin, summoned his erstwhile allies to a secret meeting. He had summoned the former Thousand Sons Chaos Sorcerer Iskandar Khayon, leader of the Kha'Sherhan warband, as well as the former World Eaters warrior Lheorvine Ukris, leader of the Fifteen Fangs warband. They had been called to meet aboard the grand wreckage of the long-dead Sons of Horus Battle Cruiser His Chosen Son. Falkus informed his allies that Lupercalios was no more. The Monument was gone -- it no longer existed beyond ashen ruin. As for the shattered Legion, he did not know how many had survived the Emperor's Children's brutal assault. For all he knew, his warband were the last survivors. Having lost everything, Falkus turned to those he could trust. Those who had been his allies in the past. He also brought them the dire news that the Warmaster Horus' body had been stolen. The IIIrd Legion had taken the body to harvest it, to reap its genetic bounty. They wanted to clone the Primarch's body. The assembled Astartes did not want to contemplate the dire consequences of such blasphemy. By resurrecting the First Primarch, the IIIrd Legion hoped to be able to end the Legion Wars.
 There was little recourse left to Falkus -- his Legion had all but been driven into extinction, the fortress of Lupercalios was gone, and he had no hope of retaliating against the Emperor's Children's capital world of Harmony with his meagre forces. There was little else he could do, but the shrewd warleader had one last desperate hand to play -- he would seek out the Vengeful Spirit. With it, he would destroy the Canticle City and the abominations the III Legion were attempting to resurrect. Those of the Nine Legions knew the vessel well -- an immense battleship, majestic beyond majesty, with its spinal fortresses and armoured prow delineating the bulky murderousness of a Scylla Pattern variant of the ancient Gloriana-class Battleship hull. It was the only Gloriana vessel in all the Emperor's fleet born from the Scylla Pattern variant construction scheme. But the task Falkus had set forth for them was all but impossible. Hundreds of warbands throughout the centuries had sought the mighty ship for centuries -- none had returned. But those hundreds of warband had no idea where to look. Falkus did.
 To prove his point, he brought forth a prisoner. His name was Sargon, once of the XVIIth Legion, the Word Bearers, and the Brazenhead Chapter. He was a former warrior-priest of the Word Bearers, for Sargon had cast aside Lorgar's teachings. He claimed to bring enlightenment and illumination, but it was no longer the Word of Lorgar. Sargon could not speak to the gathered warleaders with his own voice, as he had suffered a vicious plasma burn that had taken both his larynx and voice box during the Battle of Terra. Utilising his innate psychic abilities, he spoke through a reanimated corpse, one of many fallen Sons of Horus Legionaries that lay in piles, scattered around the once-mighty battleship. Sargon claimed that he had not only seen the Vengeful Spirit, he had also trod the decks of the mighty flagship himself. He knew its location -- the Radiant Worlds -- located in the Eleusinian Veil on the far age of the Eye, near Imperial space, beyond the massive Warp phenomena known as the Firetide. Sargon had surrendered himself to Falkus following the destruction of Lupercalios. He had done so, claiming that fate demanded it. He knew where the Vengeful Spirit was hidden, and brought forth the lore to those who needed it most. Though the Chaos Sorcerer Khayon sensed that the priest was telling the truth, he was unable to probe the priest's mind any further for answers. Whoever had sent him had placed powerful psychic wards that locked the Word Bearer's mind from unwanted intrusion. After some thought, he agreed to assist Falkus. The World Eater warleader never had the chance to agree or disagree. Their enemies did not allow it.
 A small fleet of Emperor's Children vessels appeared from the surrounding Warp Storm -- seven vessels that bore Imperial purple armour plating bleach-burned into ghostly lilac. Falkus and his allies had five ships against the IIIrd Legion's seven. Even one-on-one the mighty Emperor's Children ships would destroy the rag-tag warbands' vessels. Whoever wanted them dead had arranged their murders to perfection. The lead vessel that sailed at the front of the murder-fleet was a Battleship, it blunt prow shaped into the golden, ripped-wing avatar of a crucified Imperial Aquila. This ship alone was capable of tearing all five of the opposing vessels to pieces. The commander of the vessel hailed the sorcerer Khayon. He identified himself as Kadalus Orlantir, born of Chemos, Sardar of the Emperor's Children warband comprising its former 16th, 40th and 51st Companies, and commander of the warship Perfection's Lament. He informed the sorcerer that he had no quarrel with either Khayon or the World Eater but demanded that they hand over Sargon. Both warleaders audaciously refused the Sardar's ""generous"" offer. Enraged, the IIIrd Legion commander launched boarding assaults against both Khayon's vessel, the Tlaloc, and the wrecked warship where the three leaders were undertaking their secret meeting. In the fight that followed, Falkus and Lheor attempted to flee to their separate vessels, but Lheor's ship was destroyed. Utilising his psychic arts, Khayon was able to cut a hole in the fabric of reality that led to the bridge of his vessel, allowing them to escape. But not before taking the Emperor's Children's severely wounded commander and seven of his Legionaries as prisoners.
 Reaching the Eleusinian Veil meant passing through the Radiant Worlds. Only a fool would take their ship directly into them and face the destructive waves of Warp energy known as the Firetide. Though Khayon's vessel could not sail through the region of psychic flame, they could cut past it, by utilising the secret paths behind reality and unreality alike, the Webway. Though most of the Webway's pathways inside the Great Eye's border were worthless and shattered from Slaanesh's devastating birth-scream, for those who knew where to look, there were a rare few that were considered viable avenues through the Traitor Legions' purgatorial domain. Khayon knew of one such secret path into the Webway -- the so-called Avernus Breach. He had learned of it a century before -- and the price of that knowledge was six standard years of service to a Night Lords Legion warband -- six years of binding daemons and destroying the warband's enemies. After approximately a solar month's time of travel through the stygian depths of the null dimension of the Webway, the Tlaloch reached its destination -- the Radiant Worlds. Located on the edge of Imperial space, where the Warpspace of the Great Eye and realspace collided, most of the worlds within this region were uninhabitable, lost in the lethal crash of conflicting psychic energies. The Radiant Worlds were forever bathed in the psychic light of the Astronomican, the psychic beacon that guided the Imperium's vessels through the Immaterium, without burning in it.
 Amidst a massive asteroid field located on the edge of the Eleusinian Veil, the Tlaloch came to the former Eldar world of Aas'ciaral, which meant ""Heart's Song"" in the Eldar Lexicon. Its most drastic wound was the source of the asteroid field, for an entire half of the planet was simply gone. Such horrendous damage to an astral body should have destroyed the world completely, yet Aas'ciaral still lived, deformed as it drifted through the vast ash cloud. The face of the planet was cataracted by turgid storms covering the entire world in milky clouds. Lightning wracked the occluded skies in random dances. After several solar days of searching the surface for any signs of life, the crew of the Tlaloch discovered a gigantic downed voidship, half-buried in the snow at the bottom of a deep ravine. Khayon, his bound she-wolf daemon Gyre, Lheor and the swordsman Kadalus took to the surface. Searching the ravine, they came upon the massive warship. Abaddon had taken this vessel, the Vengeful Spirit itself, past the Firetide of the Radiant Worlds, into the unscannable depths of the Eleusinian Veil, and powered the ship down beneath the surface of this broken world. The audaciousness of the plan was truly overwhelming for the Traitor Marines who had come seeking the former First Captain.
 The Legionaries finally made their way inside the massive vessel and began their search in earnest. After many hours, they finally were approached by a massive Legionary who wore weathered and colour-faded armour scavenged and cannibilised from warriors of all Nine Traitor Legions, with a long fall of ratty, snarled black hair stringing across his features, half hiding his face. He possessed unnatural, inhuman gold-coloured eyes. After brief introductions, the Legionary raked his fingers through the mane of filthy hair, revealing a pitted, pale face that defied any attempt to discern age. War was written across his features in a lattice of old cuts and the pockmarks of heat-scarring. Battle marked him even if age had not. Though he no longer wore the great black war-plate of the Justaerin, nor was his hair bound up in the ceremonial topknot of the Cthonian subterranean work-gangs, he was still easily recognisable. The Sons of Horus Legionary was now a hollow shadow of the invincible warrior who once graced victory hololiths and Imperial propaganda transmissions, but he was easily recognisable by the other assembled Legionaries. He had worn the same expression on Terra, as the Imperial Palace had burned around them. They had found Ezekyle Abaddon.
 Abaddon explained to his fellow Legionaries that it was he who had summoned them there. He had sent Sargon to Falkus in order to lure them to the Vegeful Spirit. Though they were not the only souls he had called to him, they had the honour of being the first. Abaddon sought warriors who wished to be more than the legacies of their diminished Legions. He knew that these warriors who had sought him out no longer considered themselves brothers of their respective Legions. Their former Legions' names no longer rang proud in their heats and souls. They were no longer the sons of their fathers, respecting them and embodying their failures. Abaddon's prophet Sargon had looked into the skeins of fate and saw that there was more to all of them than the call of worthless bloodlines. But that was not the only reason he had summoned them. Abaddon knew that a reborn Horus could not be allowed to walk once more. Not because of destiny, or fate, or the whims of the Pantheon of Chaos. The First Primarch, mockingly called the Sacrificed King by the Neverborn (Daemons), had died in shame and failure. The former First Captain's gift to his Legion when he abandoned them was to let them die with dignity. The Emperor's Children and their allies now threatened that dignified end. Abaddon was done with cold allegiances and temporary alliances. If he was to return to the battles raging throughout the Eye of Terror, he sought something more real, something pure. A war that meant something.
 Sharing his vision with the assembled Legionaries, Abaddon knew that they all could become so much more than their fathers' sons. Both he, and those Legionaries before him, all craved true, honest brotherhood. They all missed it -- a Space Marine Legion's unity and its bonds of loyalty. Its explicit purpose. Its focused pursuit of victory. Abaddon missed what a Legion could do, and the fact it was empowered to do it. All of the Nine Traitor Legions, they were Legions in name, colour and the dregs of culture, but they were a horde, not an army, linked by fading loyalties and fighting to survive. Once they were bound by brotherhood and fought only to win. Their kind no longer waged war, they raided and pillaged. They no longer marched in regiments and battalions, but scattered in packs and warbands. Abaddon had no wish to change how things were -- he wished to embrace it. He knew that many amongst the Nine Traitor Legions cried out to be part of a true Legion once more. Abaddon's pilgrimage with Sargon had been more than learning how the tides of the Eye of Terror ebbed and flowed. It was about seeking those who would stand with him.
 The former High Chieftain of the Justaerin saw the true strength and purity in what they had become. There was a savage honesty in the Nine Traitor Legions' warbands now. They followed warlords of their choosing instead of those assigned to them. They created traditions rooted in the cultures of their parent Legion, or completely defied their origins according to their own whims. Abaddon shared his vision for taking what the Nine Legion now had and refining it -- perfecting it. He meant to form a new Legion. A new war. The real war, the Long War. Not a petty rebellion swallowed by Horus' pride and his hunger for the Terran Throne. A war for the future of Mankind. Horus would have sold out Humanity to the Pantheon of Chaos for the chance to sit on the Golden Throne for a single heartbeat. But the Nine Traitor Legions could now allow themselves to be used the way Horus had been. The Chaos Gods existed and they could not pretend otherwise, nor could they allow a sacred duty to devolve into such weakness, as Horus did.
 Revelation was a long process. Abaddon was now wiser than he had been during his father's rebellion. He had seen a great deal more of what the galaxy could offer, as well as what lay behind reality's veil. But he was not arrogant. He knew there was a great deal left to do, and a great deal left to learn. All he knew for certain was that he was finished with his years walking along. So now he reached out to those most like him -- in thought, in action, and in ambition. Abaddon did not offer any of them a place in a tyrant's plan. What he offered them was a place at his side as they found a path together -- brotherhood. A brotherhood for the brotherless.
 After being reunited with former Justaerin Commander Falkus Kibre aboard the Tlaloch, the Legionaries returned to the dormant flagship. They gathered on the Vengeful Spirit 's command deck, where Horus and his Primarch brothers had once stood with the lord-captains of the Space Marine Legions, first presiding over the fate of the Great Crusade, then deciding the fate of the rebellion. Now these few Legionaries, with Abaddon at their head, the genesis of the Ezekarion and the future Black Legion, had gathered around the central hololithic table to plan their assault upon the Emperor's Children's Canticle City. Falkus Kibre, the ""Widowmaker,"" last chieftain of the broken Justaerin and lord of the Duraga kal Esmejhak warband stood with them. With Kibre were almost thirty of his brothers, clad in the heavy war plate of their murderous clan. Telemachon Lyras, Sword-Captain of the Emperor's Children. Ashur-Kai, the ""White Seer,"" sorcerer and sage of the Thousand Sons. He stood with a phalanx of Rubricae, numbering one hundred and four of his ashen brothers. Lheorvine Ukris, known to all as Lheor, and much to his gall, as ""Firefist,"" gunner-captain of the World Eaters and commander of the Fifteen Fangs warband. He stood with former Sergeant Ugrivian and their four surviving brothers, each one holding a massive Heavy Bolter. Sargon Eregesh, Abaddon's oracle, a former warrior-priest of the Word Bearers' Brazenhead Chapter. And finally, Iskandar Khayon, sorcerer and sage of the Thousand Sons and warleader of the Kha'Sherhan warband. There was no formal order beneath the dusty banners of the past, only warriors speaking of their intent. Each of the gathered Legionaries spoke of Legions they no longer believed in, of Primarch fathers they no longer idolised, of daemonic Legion homeworlds they refused to claim as havens. These were soldiers citing their histories, laying out how their hatreds and talents alike bound them together to a greater whole.
 These were mere formalities before Abaddon spoke the reason they were gathered together. These warriors had not been brought together to talk of the past, but by living through battle in the present. For Abaddon's ambitions to bear any weight, he would have to give them victory. He spoke of the Canticle City and how they would plunge a spear tip through the fortress's heart. He spoke of how the Vengeful Spirit would be able to sail with a skeleton crew of the damned, guided by the powerful Machine Spirit of Khayon's ship, known as the Anamnesis. Abaddon spoke of the threat posed by Horus Reborn. Distant as the threat seemed to be, for surely the Emperor's Children had decades of failed alchemical experimentation ahead of them, they would hit it before it became a threat, striking to prevent the Emperor's Children winning the Legion Wars. Abaddon cared nothing for extinguishing the XVI Legion's shame -- he cared only for casting aside those last shackles from the past. The Primarchs were dead or ascended past mortal concerns in the tides of the Great Game of the Gods. As he finished speaking, Abaddon promised them a place aboard the Vengeful Spirit if they desired it -- if they would stand with him for this one brutal assault. They would form a new Legion -- forged as they desired, not as slaves to the Emperor's will and cast in the image of His flawed Primarchs. Bound together by loyalty and ambition, not nostalgia and desperation. Untainted by the past they would no longer be the sons of failed fathers.
 The first time any of the gathered warriors had seen the Canticle City was the night they darkened the skies of the Daemon World of Harmony. Despite the breaking of Emperor's Children at Skalathrax, the Canticle City served as a haven to many IIIrd Legion warbands and their allies. It was a populated world with ore-rich moons claimed in turn by feuding Dark Mechanicum city-states. yet, for all of the Vengeful Spirit 's size and strength, only a handful of warriors populated the Battleship's halls. Even in orbit, their enemies outnumbered them twenty to one. Though the odds were heavily stacked against them, Abaddon and his fellow Legionaries would carry the day through the assault's audacity and through loyalty to one another. They would win by going for the throat. The sorcerer Khayon was burdened with a heavy duty at Abaddon's request. A monumental task that did not allow for Khayon to spare his attention for anything else. As the Vengeful Spirit sailed towards Harmony, the Thousand Sons sorcerer used all his psychic abilities to pull a monumental weight in their wake.
 After several months' passage, the Vengeful Spirit arrived at their intended target. Waking Khayon from his meditative state, Abaddon asked the sorcerer if he was ready to do his duty. As the Vengeful Spirit moved closer to their intended target they were beset by an unrelenting barrage from the Emperor's Children fleet which ringed the massive flagship. Weapons-fire hammered uselessly against the Vengeful Spirit's inviolate shields. The moment of truth came at last. Abaddon ordered Khayon to launch the spear. Mustering his strength one last time on the immense weight out there in the void, Khayon first raked back the concealing shroud of Aetheria hiding the spear from sight. The enemy fleet immediateley turned their guns upon it. Abaddon screamed at Khayon to launch the spear. The sorcerer rose to his feet, hands curled into claws as he screamed at the city he was about to kill. With every iota of concentration he possessed, Khayon hurled the spear at the world called Harmony.
 The Canticle City was prepared to repel assaults, with its skyline's armoured bastions aiming defence turrets and flak cannons towards the heavens. But while fighting back an invasion was one thing, resisting a cataclysm was another. A black shape swallowed the sun, burning as it fell. The Tlaloc was almost two kilometres and eight megatonnes of ancient, ironclad anger. Once it had sailed the stars in the name of the XVth Legion, crewed by twenty-five thousand loyal souls. Khayon had telekinetically dragged its empty corpse across the Eye of Terror, just as Abaddon had asked of him. And then he hurled it right into the heart of the IIIrd Legion's fortress. Less than a solar minute passed from the moment the derelict vessel entered Harmony's atmosphere to the second it struck the ground. Long enough to let the population see death falling towards them. Not long enough to do anything about it. The Vengeful Spirit 's sensors recorded tectonic unrest grave enough to send tremors rippling across the other side of the world. Harmony itself heaved with torment. In the aftermath of the devastating attack, Canticle City was no more. A screaming maelstrom of liquid fire and violence had torn out in all directions from the Tlaloc ' impact site. Everywhere was dust, ashes and flame. Satisfied that rightful vengeance had been served upon the IIIrd Legion, Abaddon ordered his flagship to be taken back up into high orbit.
 As the Vengeful Spirit rose higher into orbit, the first ships rose from the battered surface of Harmony. They came without formation or order, fleeing their doomed planet. The mighty Gloriana-class Battleship was merciless as its guns opened fire on the enemy refugee ships, sending some back to the ground in flames, letting others pass untouched. As the Vengeful Spirit continued its brutal barrage, Sargon informed Abaddon that their primary objective had been spotted -- the Pulchritudinous, a Lunar-class Cruiser, Halcyon Pattern variant hull of the IIIrd Legion. It had been born on the orbital docks above sacred Mars. Abaddon ordered his crew to let the other voidships run. Though they could have decimated the enemy vessel with the Vengeful Spirit 's mighty prow Lances, Abaddon ordered the guns to stand down.
 They would take the enemy vessel by conducting a boarding action. The taking of the Pulchritudinous would shape Abaddon's Traitor Legionaries before they formally wore his newborn Legion's black. It would be the first time the preferred style of warfare of the nascent Black Legion would be displayed -- striking with overwhelming force to achieve a single goal. Let the Four Gods empower whomever they chose.
 Abaddon had cast the enemy in disarray, then went for the throat. Victory above all else -- the mantra of the Black Legion. The Legionaries struck the enemy ship's hull. Drills and magna-melters quickly chewed their way through compacted adamantium alloy, as the assault pods bore their way down into the iron flesh of the Pulchritudinous. As Abaddon's warriors entered the enemy vessel, they soon came upon a flesh-crafted horror -- part daemon, part lab-forged monstrosity, that was prowling the deck. They quickly dispatched the vile creature.
 Khayon inquired of the former Emperor's Children swordsman, Telemachon, who commanded this vessel. The swordsman informed him that it was commanded by none other than Primogenitor Fabius, the so-called ""Clone Lord."" He also remarked that they did not call the vessel the Pulchritudinous any longer, now the Emperor's Children called it the Fleshmarket. Telemachon also informed his companions that they should count their dark blessings that they boarded this ship during the confusion and chaos of an evacuation. This ship was a fortress of horrors. If the Primogenitor had prepared for them, they would already be dead.
 Even so, the Legionaries pressed on, encountering no shortage of resistance from the foulness left to wander and rot in the ship's halls. Bonecrafted human thralls and monstrous Daemons that reeked of alchemical meddling. The assault party fought for an indeterminate amount of time before reaching a chamber large enough for the next stage of Abaddon's plan. Khayon contacted his fellow sorcerer Ashur-Kai aboard the Vengeful Spirit 's bridge. Both of them utilised their powerful sorcery to simultaneously tear open portals in the fabric of reality, which would enable the  Terminator armoured Justaerin to stride forth between the two ships, instantaneously. The first to step through the conduit was an armoured giant in massive black Terminator war-plate. It was Abaddon himself. His veins ran black beneath his sallow skin. His gaze burned with psychic gold. In one hand he carried a battered Power Sword, in the other -- the claws of his right hand were scythe blades still ringing with the resonance of the Emperor's murder. For the first time, he wore the Talon of Horus. It was in this first moment that Abaddon became his warriors' Warmaster as well as their brother-in-arms. Behind him came the hulking forms of Falkus and the Justaerin, shadows coalescing into reality as they passed through the conduit. Abaddon had chosen to wear the Talon in the poetry of the moment. With his father's own weapon, he would destroy all hope of his rebirth.
 The battle was brief with Abaddon leading the way, followed by thirty Justaerin, six World Eaters and one hundred Rubricae, the Black Legionaries slaughtered everything alive on the ship between where they came aboard and where they found Primogenitor Fabius. The warship's halls ran with blood and filth, runnels of it straining through to the lower decks, raining gore on the slave too wise to stand against the intruders. Squads of Emperor's Children took positions at critical junctures to defend their master's vessel, pouring Bolter fire down the corridors. But the Terminator plate of the Justaerin was proof against most of the punishing barrage. Implacably, the Justaerin advanced, and those who stood against them died beneath claws and hammers, each falling blow ending a life. Those who fled bought their lives at the cost of pride. Abaddon led them, killing with his sword and the double-barrelled Storm Bolter mounted on the Talon's bulk. But the claw's blades, still stained with Sanguinius' and the Emperor's lives, remained unsullied. Only when they reached the Apothecarion did they break their stride. All of the Traitor Legionaries present had long been inured to horror, for it was not the abundance of flesh heresy taking place inside the chambers that brought them to a halt. It was the fact that the overseer of this foul place had succeeded in his endeavours. This was not a laboratory of those who struggled and failed to manipulate one of the most arcane and flawed sciences. This was the sanctum of madmen who had already succeeded.
 They had been wrong all this time. The Emperor's Children were not unknowable years away from a cloning genesis. They had already mastered that darkest lore. Here was the Emperor's sacred genetic project rebuilt through daemonic lore and gutter genius. Row upon row of life pods contained mutated children and deformed adolescents. These were not just any children, they were replicated clones of the twenty Primarchs! The chamber had room for hundreds of tanks. Many sockets were empty, but the majority housed thrumming life pods with barely visible limbs moving through the carrion water. This chamber alone represented heresy beyond measure. It was not known if there were any more such tanks or whether this was all the Primogenitor could evacuate from Harmony. The Chief Apothecary of the IIIrd Legion came forth from an adjoining annex chamber and approached the band of interlopers. He had the audacity to entreat Abaddon and his warriors to take his side with sympathy, lamenting the loss of centuries of study and irreplaceable work. Disgusted by the fleshcrafter's words, Abaddon ordered Khayon to destroy the vile hell-spawned creations. The sorcerer sent a mental command to his Rubricae warriors, ""Leave nothing alive,"" and with a roar of a hundred Bolters, the Rubricae rained a tide of explosive fire across the laboratory. A second later the Justaerin and every warrior present joined in. After what seemed an eternity, the guns fell quiet. Fabius taunted Abaddon that some things never changed, chiding him for still using the brute application of violence to solve all his problems. Abaddon explained to the Chief Apothecary that everything had indeed changed. Suddenly the sound of more bootsteps could be heard from the same annex chamber from which Fabius emerged. A heavier tread. Measured, confident. The Apothecary's eyes focused on the Talon Abaddon wore on his right hand, commenting that ""He will enjoy the irony of that."" Abaddon narrowed his eyes and asked, ""He?"" And that is when death came for them.
 A massive figure emerged from the annex chamber, swinging the immense maul Worldbreaker, a gift made to Horus by the Emperor Himself upon the First Primarch's ascension to the rank of Warmaster, into the first rank of Rubricae, sending three of them crashing against the shell-pocked walls. The figure then turned towards the Traitor Legionaries' loose ranks and charged. This was not a child cloned from scraps of tissue and drops of blood. Nor an abomination half lost to mutation's touch. It was Horus Lupercal, cloned from dead flesh harvested directly form his stasis-preserved corpse, clad in the breathtaking black war-plate stripped from his dead body, replete with the long fall of his white-wolf fur cloak and the pale shimmer of a kinetic force field protecting him like a halo. Horus Reborn charged into the Legionaries and began to slaughter them with Worldbreaker. Lheor and the last warriors of the Fifteen Fangs reacted faster than any of their comrades. Their Heavy Bolters opened up, firing their explosive rounds at the former Warmaster of the Imperium, with every bolt hitting home. But even as their bolts tore at Horus's armour and flesh, their initiative did little but doom them before the rest of their fellow warriors. The gathered warriors broke before the cloned Warmaster's onslaught and fell back, scattering to the edges of the room to escape the immense war maul of the enraged revenant. Khayon hurled bolt after bolt of mutagenic warpfire at Horus Reborn. It burst what remained of the creature's force field in a whiplash of air pressure, and boiled the skin and hair from its head. He came for the sorcerer and beat him mercilessly with the deadly maul, nearly killing him. Others attempted to cease the revenant's rampage, but all fell before the cloned-Primarch's might.
 Abaddon stood behind Horus, and with a single word he halted the Primarch's rampage. ""Enough."" He had barely even raised his voice, as the absolute authority in his tone was all that was required. Horus turned in a blur, swinging the massive war maul at this newest threat. Abaddon not only parried the mace, he caught it. He held it. He gripped it in the great Talon stained with the blood of a god and His angel. Father and son faced each other, breathing spite into each other's snarling features. For the first time the Primarch spoke, ""That. Is. My. Talon."" Abaddon closed the massive fist. Worldbreaker broke, shattering against a superior weapon. Scrap metal fell from Abaddon's finger. Despite the legends and stories told about this moment, there were no entreaties made to his gathered sons and nephews; no glorious speech about the possibilities of a new era, or how he begged for mercy when faced with Justaerin blades. There was no impassioned judgement delivered by Abaddon as destiny changed hands from one Warmaster to the next. There was only a cloned father and a prodigal son, surrounded by the dead and the wounded, so similar that only by their weapons and wounds could you tell them apart.
 Recognition finally flared in the revenant's remaining eye. ""Ezekyle. My son. My son."" All five of Abaddon's claws rammed so deeply into Horus's chest that they burst from his back. Dark redness spread across what was left of the white fur cloak draped in tatters across Horus's shoulders. A genetic god's blood rained down to the filthy laboratory floor. The Storm Bolter on the Talon's back kicked three times, burying six bolts inside Horus's exposed chest and neck. They blasted him apart from within, sending viscera and blood splattering upon those left prone, watching in mute witness. Horus' knees buckled but Abaddon would not let him fall. Horus's mouth worked but no sound came forth. If his last words found any voice, Abaddon was the only one to hear it. With a slow, smooth withdrawal, Abaddon pulled the Talon clear of his father's body, and the moment before Horus fell -- the moment before the light finally went out in the reborn Primarch's eyes -- Ezekyle Abaddon whispered five soft words. ""I am not your son.""
 Their fortress in ruins and their Legion decimated, the Sons of Horus stood on the brink of vanishing forever from the galaxy and fading into cursed memory. The XVI Legion devolved into in-fighting amongst themselves, giving in to dark despair or uncontrolled rage. The divisions between the Legion's captains turned into bitter bloodshed and murder, as order completely collapsed. The salvation of the Sons of Horus came when one of its greatest captains, Ezekyle Abaddon, returned from his Dark Pilgrimage in time to watch the battle from afar. It was in that moment that he saw, with cold clarity, that it was Horus' failure that had led the Legion here, to them tearing each other apart in the blood-soaked ruins of Maeleum. Abaddon swore that he would succeed where Horus had failed in overthrowing the ""Corpse-Emperor"" and proclaimed himself the new Warmaster of Chaos. Finally, sickened by how far the Legion had fallen, he stalked through the ruins hunting down his fellow captains, cooling his rage with their final screams. In the end, Abaddon alone remained of the Legion's leaders, demanding obedience from his brothers.
 Some saw Abaddon as Horus' rightful successor and fell at his feet willingly, while others recognised his raw strength and bowed their heads to his might. A few turned their back on Abadodn, and were either cut down by their brothers or managed to escape into the Warp. With his Legion brought to heel, Abaddon turned his attention to the clones of Horus; he commanded his warriors to extinguish all trace of their former Primarch and free themselves from his shadow. He then personally led an attack on the Emperor's Children that destroyed the body of the Primarch Horus and all its clones, and in so doing, ushered in a new age for the XVI Legion. He had the Sons of Horus repaint their viridian Power Armour black, the colour of mourning and of vengeance, and cast-off the XVI Legion's former moniker of the Sons of Horus. From then on, they became known as the Black Legion. Through his actions, the Despoiler had reinvigorated the Legion, reviving the old notion that none could stand in their way and that they stood first amongst the Traitor Legions, destined by the will of the Dark Gods to one day inherit the galaxy itself. When the warbands of the Black Legion and the other forces of Chaos gather under the wrathful banner of Abaddon the Despoiler to unleash yet another of their Black Crusades to overthrow the False Emperor, the words of Horus are heard upon their lips -- let the galaxy burn. The Long War for control of the galaxy by Chaos and the Black Legion had begun.
 When Abaddon ascended to command of the Sons of Horus, not every warrior of the XVIth Legion swore allegiance to him. Many of the Traitors clung to their worship of Horus as a god, believing that he would one day return to lead them and punish those who had forsaken their oaths. Others considered the Horus Heresy to be the end of their subservience to gods and masters; the Emperor and their Primarch were the last overlords they would ever bow down to and they saw no reason to make an exception for Abaddon. Most of these Renegades were gradually lost to the Warp, disappearing into the Eye and vanishing from record, though some prospered and would return to be a thorn in the side of Abaddon.
 One of these splinter warbands was the Sons of the Eye, led by Drecarth the Sightless. A former Battle-Brother of Abaddon's, Drecarth had been one of Horus' captains, escaping in the chaos after Maeleum fell. Abaddon had heard whispers of Drecarth's escape and treachery from his cabal of Chaos Sorcerers, who also claimed that an old ally would one day rise to subert the Black Legion, twisting its loyalty with the memory of the dead Primarch. So, under the guise of truce, Abaddon made a pact with the Sons of the Eye and allied with them during the 6th Black Crusade in 901.M36. Abaddon wanted to make an example of the Sons of the Eye, a dire warning to any that would consider challenging his power, but he needed to set the stage for his vengeance just right so that none would ever doubt his resolve.
 During the 6th Black Crusade, Abaddon besieged the Imperial Forge World of Arkreach, offering Drecarth and his Sons of the Eye an equal share of the plunder. For months, the two forces of Chaos Space Marines fought side-by-side against the defences of the Adeptus Mechanicus, bombarding their great forge cities from space. Finally, the Traitors stood triumphant in the smouldering ruins of the great manufactoria, dead littering the ground. As Drecarth extended his hand in greeting, Abaddon grasped it with his own, only to thrust the claws of the Talon of Horus into his fellow Chaos Space Marine's gut. Drecarth lived long enough to see the Sons of the Eye bow to Abaddon and be reabsorbed into the Black Legion before the Warmaster of Chaos tore out his skull and spine. Thus did Abaddon deliver a dire warning to any who dared challenge his power.
 His control secured, Abaddon started expanding the ranks of the Black Legion, consumed by the desire to launch an assault against the Imperium. Word spread across the Eye of Terror that any Space Marine who bowed before the Despoiler would be granted a place in his Black Legion and a part in his grand plan for revenge against the False Emperor. Many of the other Traitors mocked and derided Abaddon for his arrogance. However, the endless wars and corruption of the Warp had sown disillusion in the hearts of others and the promise of a place in a Legion led by a warlord determined to continue the war against the Imperium appealed to a great number. The insulting defeat at the hands of the Loyalist Space Marine Legions was still fresh in the minds of many of the Chaos Space Marines, and they hungered for a chance to spill the blood of their former brothers. Other Traitor Legionaries cared not whose blood they spilled, only that Abaddon could lead them to worlds where they could tear piteous screams from the dying and crush the corpses of their foes underfoot. The legend of Abaddon was also spreading, and those Traitor Marines who respected only strength, cruelty and dark majesty already marked him out as a Chaos warlord to rule all others.
 Abaddon soon earned an enduring reputation among the Traitor Legions for the terrifying vengeance he visited upon those who betrayed him. Some Traitor Legionaries and daemonic warlords attempted to use the Black Legion for their own ends, infiltrating its ranks with false promises of loyalty. Others attempted to whisper promises in the ears of those that had sworn fealty to the Black Legion and tried to turn them against the Despoiler. In the end, the heads of all those Chaos Champions and Chaos Lords adorned Abaddon's trophy rack, their warbands destroyed and their fortresses torn down stone by stone. Eventually, only the very foolish or terminally insane would break their oath to Abaddon the Despoiler.
 The new Warmaster was a master of manipulation and knew just what combination of fear, greed and vanity would sway the minds of both men and daemons. Warlords would come before Abaddon merely to verify this Champion of Chaos and his Black Legion for themselves, but found themselves scorching their armour black and joining his cause. As the numbers of the Black Legion swelled, Abaddon ravaged the worlds of the Eye of Terror with his fleet, claiming more warriors and slaves for his cause. This time, the Despoiler was careful not to create such an easy target for his foes, and the Black Legion remained a fleet-based formation, slipping like shadows across the Warp. Aboard the Vengeful Spirit Abaddon led his war against the other Traitor Legions, their allies and their enemies, creating an army to rival any force in the galaxy.
 Such is the nature of the Traitor Legions that no individual warlord could ever rule over all of them, but Abaddon hoped to one day unite them toward a single goal as Horus had done before him. The Black Legion could only hope to destroy the Emperor and His Imperium with the help of the other Traitor Legions, combining to brush aside the armies ranged against them and launch a single massive assault on Terra. This was Abaddon's dark dream and the path that would shape his destiny for centuries to come.
 While other Chaos Space Marine warlords were content to make pacts with individual Chaos Gods and daemons, eagerly giving up control for a sliver of power, Abaddon was different. In the long decades of the Great Crusade and the bloody years of the Horus Heresy that followed, he had studied the way in which Horus had waged his wars and dominated his allies. What Abaddon observed was, first, the hand of the Emperor and then later the influence of the Dark Gods at work, limiting the greatness of his Primarch and ultimately leading to his demise. Abaddon would make no such mistake, and though he would court the Chaos Gods as allies, he vowed, foolishly perhaps, never to be completely in their thrall.
 It is still unclear how Abaddon was able to use the will of the Dark Gods for his own ends while remaining unscathed by their power. Some say that it is the blood he shares with Horus, fuelling old rumours that he was the Warmaster's one pure clone son. Others say that Abaddon was broken in some fundamental way by the death of his Primarch and the defeat on Terra, his mind consumed by hatred and rage until nothing of his humanity remained. Another tale maintains that Abaddon was never human at all and is instead a construct of the Dark Gods -- an expression of their hatred for Mankind. Whatever the reason, the Ruinous Powers chose Abaddon to be their champion and gifted him with a freedom of will denied to so many of their servants, perhaps impressed by the audacity and grandeur of his vengeance.
 Regardless of how this favour was won, the period after the destruction of the clones of Horus during the Slave Wars and the renaming of the Sons of Horus was a time of war and domination for Abaddon and the Black Legion. As it grew in size and strength, it exerted its power over the other Chaos Space Marine warbands within the Eye of Terror, crushing and absorbing countless lesser warbands, bending them to the will of the Legion and adding their strength to its growing ranks. Meanwhile, Abaddon also sought other ways both to increase his personal power and to learn all he could about the new and dangerous realm in which the Traitor Legionaries found themselves. The Despoiler had already discovered much during his own Dark Pilgrimage, the journey he took in the lost years between the end of the Horus Heresy and his return to the ruins of Maeleum. On his travels, he had learned that the power that daemons represented and embodied could be harnessed and controlled, just as one man might control another. He also realised that the Eye of Terror was a place containing unnumbered arcane devices, forbidden weapons and lost worlds, the likes of which were unknown to much of the galaxy -- and that many of them could be turned to his ends.
 In 781.M31, five centuries after his retreat from Terra, Abaddon returned to Imperial space at the head of a host of Traitors and daemons. It was the Imperium's first encounter with the newly founded Black Legion and the return of a brutal and bitter enemy many had thought lost to the graveyard of history. Since the Great Scouring, Abaddon had remained within the Eye of Terror, rebuilding the Black Legion as a vengeful reflection of its former glory. At last, the Black Legion and the other Traitors returned to realspace, the first chapter in their Long War against the Emperor ready to be written in the blood of Imperial worlds. Through alliance, threats and promises, Abaddon was able to muster the largest force of Traitor Legions seen since the Horus Heresy and took the Imperium by surprise. Worlds close to the Eye of Terror fell into mayhem and chaos as Legions descended from the sky and daemons tore their way into reality. Only Cadia, with its formidable defences, stood firm, its brave regiments fighting from the towering gates and bastions of their cities.
 To counter the invasion, the Imperium was forced to divert many of the newly-formed Space Marine Chapters of the Second Founding from war zones across the Segmentum Obscurus. The Traitor Legions basked in their return from the Eye of Terror, bathing in the blood of innocent worlds and filling the holds of their voidships with slaves. On a dozen planets, the Black Legion proved worthy of their fallen Primarch and the martial prowess of the ancient Luna Wolves. Abaddon had chosen his generals well, and each competed for glory as the Legion tore a bloody gouge across the stars. The Black Legion's greatest achievement was not only its brutal victories, but also the unity it had managed to forge among the Traitors and their daemonic allies. Even though the Traitor Space Marines, daemons and Heretics turned on each other once Imperial resistance had been crushed, in the presence of the Black Legion, they gave grudging respect. This was the Legion of fear and domination Abaddon had wrought, and it was to be an ominous sign of things to come for the Imperium.
 In what would become a festering thorn in the side of the Imperium, the Traitor Legions, often led by the Black Legion or even Abaddon himself, would repeatedly spill out of the Eye of Terror to burn and pillage entire sectors. In the light of dying stars and flaming cities, the Black Legion would indulge their hatred of the Imperium, indiscriminately killing the servants of the False Emperor and tearing down anything they saw as a symbol of the Corpse-God. During these so-called ""Black Crusades"", whole star systems would be destroyed in conflicts that would drag on for standard decades or centuries until, as suddenly as they had appeared, the Black Legion would retreat into the Eye of Terror, their holds filled with slaves and plunder. The Segmentum Obscurus suffered terribly in these endless wars against the fallen Space Marine Legions, but in truth nowhere was safe from their treacherous reach. This was something the Black Legion proved time and again as it cemented its infamous reputation among the armies of the Imperium as a pitiless foe.
 As the bloodshed of the 1st Black Crusade reached its frenzied heights, cities burned and worlds were stripped of people to feed the dark desires of the Traitor Legions. Leaving his Black Legion to continue their brutal reprisals and raids against Imperial worlds, Abaddon pursued his own plans. Using the howling souls unleashed into the Warp by so much death and destruction, he made a secret daemonic bargain. In payment for the feast of despair, pain and anguish Abaddon had created with his Black Crusade, the Dark Gods gifted him with knowledge of the secret location of the Tower of Silence on the world of Uralan.
 Cloaked in the shadow of the Eye of Terror, Uralan was whispered of in daemonic lore as a place where the gods themselves locked away their secrets. Following strands of fate unravelled by his cabal of Chaos Sorcerers, Abaddon had discovered a concealed path through the Warp and across the shifting sea of worlds beyond to reach Uralan without needing to breach the Cadian Gate. With a cadre of the Black Legion's elite warriors, each one a brutal veteran of a thousand battles, Abaddon set foot on Uralan and entered the Tower of Silence. Almost at once, the tower's guardians set upon them, ancient constructs of dark energy that shifted and flickered, their claws tearing at the ragged edges of his warriors' souls.
 After the bitter battle, Abaddon climbed down into the mirrored heart of Uralan. There, Abaddon wandered the massive haunted labyrinth for what seemed an age, fighting off the spirits of the dead that threatened to add him to their ranks. Eventually, Abaddon made his way towards the centre of the labyrinth where a shard of shifting darkness hung suspended in the air. Reaching out into the void, Abaddon felt the cold hilt of a blade meet his palm and he pulled it into reality; the Daemonsword Drach'nyen took terrible shape before his eyes. After the recovery of the malefic sword, Abaddon's power swelled to inhuman proportions and the new Warmaster of Chaos become nigh unstoppable. Whole cities were burned in sacrifice to the every-hungry daemons of Chaos, and entire armies were torn apart by gibbering Warp entities. Abaddon's power swelled to inhuman proportions as the Gods of Chaos rewarded him lavishly and he undertook acts of fiendish bravery which horrified those who stood against him.
 Infused with the might of Chaos, the Black Legion grew in power and glory during the 1st Black Crusade. Under the command of Abaddon, they seized ever more victories and triumphs. It was a glorious time for the XVIth Legion, as the bloodshed and death of the Crusade washed away some of the memories of the Horus Heresy and their great defeat before the gates of the Emperor's Palace. However, despite the reckless carnage and terrible destruction it caused, eventually, the 1st Black Crusade ended. Responding to the deadly peril, the Imperium had gathered its newly founded Space Marine Chapters and Titan Legions and sent them against the Traitors. Even so, scores of worlds had been silenced forever and millions of slaves were dragged screaming back into the Eye of Terror. Abaddon had tested the defences of his enemies and vastly increased his power with his newly acquired Daemonsword Drach'nyen. He also took to using the title of Warmaster of Chaos, rising to claim all that Horus had once possessed. None within the Black Legion argued Abaddon's right to the title, the 1st Black Crusade proof of his right to lead.
 For the Black Legion, their first foray out of the Eye of Terror had done much to restore their position among the Traitor Legions, fostering a new grudging respect for the black armoured warriors and their self-proclaimed Warmaster. If nothing else, Abaddon had proven that the Dark Gods favoured him, something not even the Daemon Primarchs could ignore. Conflict still sputtered and flared between the Traitor Legions, but they now had a new purpose, something they had almost forgotten in the half millennia since the fall of Horus. In the wake of the 1st Black Crusade, a time of constant raiding of Imperial space began. Abaddon was content to give a Black Legion warlord and his warband of Chaos Space Marines the chance to make a name for themselves, allowing them the freedom to strike where and when they would. He fostered this independence on one condition: the atrocities they committed must be done in the name of the Black Legion and at cost to the Emperor.
 Abaddon has long since fought to rebuild the pride and reputation of the warriors he named his Black Legion. At first, he accomplished much through sheer determination and a talent for slaughter that exceeded that of every Chaos Lord outside the gates of Khorne's own fortress. Slowly but surely, Abaddon won the grudging respect of the other Traitor Legions, leading his shattered armies again and again against the reviled Imperium of Man. As his deeds grew mightier and his base of power more solid, Abaddon succeeded in winning their support too. His impassioned words rekindled the Traitor Legions' smouldering hatred of the Emperor on dozens, perhaps hundreds of worlds. As the centuries rolled on, warriors of all the Traitor Legions fought beneath his banner. Those who opposed him were crushed, and those who joined him added their strength to the greatest army ever assembled in the Eye of Terror. When the warbands of the Black Legion gathered anew under the wrathful banner of Abaddon the Despoiler, the words of Horus were heard once more upon their lips — ""let the galaxy burn!""
 Abaddon has tested the strength of the Imperium many times in the Long War, and with each victory his power grows. Over the millennia, he has led no fewer than thirteen Black Crusades, each of which has emerged from the Warp and culminated in a spectacular invasion of realspace. The first of these saw him recover the Daemon Sword Drach'nyen, a writhing Warp entity that can rend reality wherever it strikes, and every crusade since has seen him destroy a prospective foe or claim another valuable relic for his own. During the 12th Black Crusade early in the 41st Millennium, a conflict better known in Imperial records as the Gothic War, Abaddon unleashed upon the Imperium of the ""Corpse Emperor"" his newest superweapon, the Planet Killer. This was a massive starship crafted through the amalgamation of Imperial technology and Chaotic sorcery that was capable of destroying entire worlds. However, even this formidable weapon was but a deceit, as Abaddon's real goal behind the Gothic War was not to destroy planets, but to seize the six Blackstone Fortresses, ancient weapons originally created to oppose the Necrons, which the Imperium had found abandoned and used as mere space stations, unable to divine their true purpose. Abaddon's ultimate success was only foiled by the Eldar, who had foreseen his plan through the visions of their Farseers and entered a desperate alliance with the Imperium in order to stop the Black Legion's attempt to seize all of the Blackstone Fortresses. Abaddon was forced to retreat after seizing only two of his six prizes. Though these would prove devastating enough when they were unleashed upon the Imperium nearly a thousand standard years later.
 Though the High Lords of Terra believe that these Black Crusades have been repelled, albeit at great cost, they are unaware that each was keyed to a specific goal. As epic in scale as they may be, Abaddon's Black Crusades are but stepping stones, rungs in the ladder that leads to the Despoiler's ultimate vengeance. The destiny the Despoiler has chosen is not that of daemonhood -- though he has been offered the ultimate reward of immortality by each of the Chaos Gods, he has held back from surrendering his soul to their ultimate control. The prize he seeks is nothing less than to tear the Emperor from his Golden Throne upon Terra and, in the process, plunge the Imperium into the darkness of anarchy forever. Without the Astronomican, the psychic beacon with which the Emperor steers His flock across the stars, the Imperium will swiftly collapse into a scattering of cold and lonely worlds, each easy prey for the Despoiler's nightmarish allies.
 The last and greatest of Abaddon's thirteen Black Crusades has plunged the crucial Cadian System into a war of unsurpassed intensity. The ninth planet in the system, St. Josmane's Hope, has already been utterly destroyed, and war raged across every district and kasr of Cadia itself. The uninitiated questioned the Despoiler's motives, for he had ploughed the broad-bladed spear of his invading forces right into the heart of Fortress Cadia and her many-layered defences.
 Those who knew of the daemonic bargains Abaddon struck in the depths of the Eye of Terror realised the true scale of his ambitions. Within the toxic swamps of the Plague Planet, Abaddon bartered the Chaos relic known as the Hand of Darkness for the aid of the gaunt monstrosity Mortarion, Daemon Primarch of the Death Guard, and earned the blessings of Nurgle.
 Within the surreal, spawn-infested planescapes warped by the power of Tzeentch, Abaddon gained the use of the Rubricae of the cursed Thousand Sons.
 Within the red bowels of the Goreswirl, the Despoiler duelled the finest of Angron's champions, cutting off their heads one after another with the Daemon Sword Drach'nyen before gifting the Hellfire Stone to the Daemon Primarch of the World Eaters and earning his respect in the process.
 Upon the flesh-world of Oliensis, the serpentine Daemon Prince Fulgrim swore his aid in exchange for a Pythonian psyker-innocent and the promise of a third-share of those civilians caught in the path of the Black Crusade to come. All that remained was to pave the way for the Daemon Primarchs and their hordes to breach realspace.
 Abaddon managed to unite all the forces of Chaos that exist within the Eye of Terror under his leadership as the Warmaster of Chaos in 999.M41, after many solar decades of preparation to unleash the greatest Chaos assault upon the Imperium of Man since the Horus Heresy, more than 10,000 standard years ago. This great campaign, Abaddon's 13th Black Crusade against the realms of the Emperor of Mankind, focused its assaults upon the sectors of the Segmentum Obscurus surrounding the Fortress World of Cadia and the Cadian Gate it protected.
 The Cadian Gate is the only known free passage through the roiling Warp Storms of the Eye of Terror into Imperial space, and the capture of Cadia would allow the forces of Chaos their first uninterrupted chance to assault the heart of Imperial space in millennia. In the end, after solar months of truly titanic fighting that spread across hundreds of worlds and tested the resources of the Imperial military as never before, the campaign proved successful for the servants of the Ruinous Powers despite the heroic resistance of the Cadian defenders led by the Lord Castellan Ursarkar E. Creed.
 Cadia fell when Abaddon sent the damaged wreckage of the Blackstone Fortress Will of Eternity hurtling to the planet's surface like an artificial meteor. The massive impact exterminated most of the defenders and caused the Necrontyr-built Cadian Pylons which had held the expansion of the Eye of Terror at bay for millennia to fail, allowing the great Warp rift to envelop the Fortress World at long last.
 Though Cadia itself has fallen, possession of the Cadian Gate -- the only stable path from the Eye of Terror -- still hangs in the balance. Should Abaddon triumph, the dark tide of Chaos will pour from the Eye of Terror along the length of the Crimson Path to strike at the most prized world of all -- Holy Terra itself.
 With several hundred thousand Chaos Space Marines falling upon Cadia in his name, Abaddon spilt enough blood that the walls of reality thinned to the point of total collapse, giving birth to the Great Rift that cut the Imperium in half. The gates of hell are yawning wide. Abaddon intends to drive the speartip of his Traitor Legions deeper and deeper into the Segmentum Solar, numberless daemon hordes sowing utter destruction in his wake.
 His ultimate goal is to capsize realspace itself in a localised swathe of ever-escalating battles that allow the poisonous half-realm of the Eye of Terror to bleed outward all the way to Terra. Once he completes his evil pilgrimage, the Despoiler will dash the ""Corpse-Emperor"" from His throne of lies and forge an empire of madness in the name of the Dark Gods.
 As the various Tyranid Hive Fleets are also inexorably moving towards the shining Astronomican beacon of the Emperor's mind that shines out like a light in the darkness from Terra, and the Adeptus Mechanicus reports that the Golden Throne is finally failing, it may well be that the current era of the Age of the Imperium, the Time of Ending, is well-named. In the face of the terrible threat presented by Abaddon the Despoiler and the other enemies of the Imperium, only one true hope may remain for the salvation of Mankind, drawn from the most ancient litany of the Imperial Creed: the Emperor protects...
 The Chosen of Abaddon are four powerful Chaos Lords that serve under the patronage of Abaddon the Despoiler, the Warmaster of Chaos and master of the Black Legion of Chaos Space Marines. Rather than a single force with a single leader, the Black Legion became after the Horus Heresy a mighty host of many warbands and warlords. Within this host, all would swear complete allegiance to Abaddon, and through an inner circle, he would lead them with absolute dominion. These favoured lieutenants became known as the Chosen of Abaddon.
 The Chosen were his favoured generals, standing above all others and enacting his dark will; a warped shadow of the Luna Wolves' Mournival in which he had once served. Nowhere in the galaxy can a more feared and merciless collection of tyrants be found, always eager to put entire worlds to the sword in the name of Chaos. Nowhere in the galaxy can a more feared and merciless collection of tyrants be found, always eager to put entire worlds to the sword in the name of Chaos. The last recorded deployment of a full Officio Assassinorum Execution Force was against the so-called Chosen of Abaddon. These four individuals were so hated by the Imperium of Man that an entire team of Assassins infiltrated Abaddon's flagship. This was an extraordinary event, for it is rare for even one Assassin to be sent to deal with a threat. Abaddon learned of the impending attack and laid a trap for the Assassins, slaying all four and protecting his Chosen.
 The Chosen bear an assortment of titles, reflecting their role in a past Black Crusade or honouring particular acts of cruelty for which they are infamous. Their numbers are ever-changing, for Abaddon has little tolerance for failure amongst those who serve him. The current holders of these four titles are described below.
 The Lord Ravager leads the Black Fleet of the Black Legion and its allies. It is he who first makes landfall on the surface of a world.
 The Lord Deceiver is a powerful Chaos Sorcerer whose visions of the Warp lead the Black Crusade from star system to star system.
 The Lord Corruptor is tasked with instilling fear and hatred amongst the Chaos Space Marines of the Black Legion. His trophy rack is adorned with the skulls of failed servants.
 It falls to the Lord Purgator to ensure that every man, woman and child left alive on a world conquered by the Black Legion is dragged in chains into the hold of the Legion's starships, and that no edifice remains undedicated to the Dark Gods.
 Abaddon also formed from the Black Legion's ranks a personal bodyguard known as the Bringers of Despair, among other dark titles. Selected from the strongest and most vicious of his Chaos Terminator elite, these fearsome warriors are a terrifying sight, their arrival announcing the presence of the Despoiler himself.
 Prior to the Horus Heresy, Ezekyle Abaddon looked up to his primarch Horus Lupercal as his rightful leader and a father figure, equal to, if not above the Emperor of Mankind in his esteem. As the loyal First Captain of the Luna Wolves' 1st Company, Abaddon was proud, irascible and someone who could inspire men to ""cry out for Abaddon's return"" if he were to die, though Abaddon became inexplicably darker and quicker to anger as the Great Crusade reached its final stage in the early 31st Millennium. Abaddon was prone to panic and desperation when Horus' life was in danger and quick to cast blame on others (such as the Emperor and the Luna Wolves' Apothecary Vaddon, who attempted unsuccessfully to treat Horus after the Primarch was wounded on Davin's Plague Moon).
 Initially displaying examples of dogmatic devotion towards Imperial doctrine and the traditional Imperial distrust for anything inhuman or alien, Abaddon followed Horus unquestioningly into service to Chaos and rebellion against the Emperor after the Primarch's recovery from his mortal wounding. Abaddon came to believe that the Horus Heresy was the best outcome for the Great Crusade since it would allow humanity to be ruled by a true leader like Horus rather than a weaker ruler like the Emperor. As he fell more and more under the spell of Chaos, Abaddon came to believe that winning and victory were the only things that matter and that the acquisition of power was the rightful role of the Astartes, since they should rule over their fellow men rather than just serve as their protectors and guardians as the Emperor had intended. The very fact that the Emperor had sought to replace the Primarchs and the Astartes with legions of ""mortal"" officials and bureaucrats in the governance of the Imperium after the Ullanor Crusade only further convinced Abaddon that the Emperor was a weakling and a fool who did not deserve to rule over Mankind.
 Physically, Abaddon was a towering and truly imposing Space Marine, taller even than the vast majority of his fellow Astartes, with a crested top-knot atop his shaven head and the straight nose and wide-spaced eyes reminiscent of Horus' own visage as was common among the Sons of Horus Astartes, though not enough for Abaddon to truly be a doppelganger of the Primarch.
 After the end of the Heresy, Abaddon's view of Horus abruptly changed and he came to view the defeated Warmaster with disdain in light of his new view that what truly mattered was the acquisition of power. Abaddon effectively stepped out of Horus' shadow, as was exemplified when he said, ""Horus was weak. Horus was a fool. He had the whole galaxy within his grasp and he let it slip away.""
 Abaddon also displayed the psychotic contempt for human life characteristic of most servants of Chaos and was willing to inflict an endless stream of atrocities upon other human beings so long as such actions enhanced his own power and position. Through his martial skill and personal might and the obvious favour he held among the Ruinous Powers after Horus' death, Abaddon won the respect of the other Traitor Legions and proved to be an inspiration to the Chaos Space Marines who dwell within the Eye of Terror. Some of the Traitor Legions, namely the Word Bearers under the leadership of the Dark Apostle Erebus, think that Abaddon is not fit for the position of Warmaster of Chaos and their cause would be better served if it was lead by a leader with more strategic acumen and less temperamental choler.
 Abaddon's troops among the Traitor Legions and the other forces of Chaos know that he will not accept failure in any form, much like his divine masters, and follow his every command without question. He is the only person to command the obedience of all 9 Traitor Legions during a Black Crusade; no other Chaos Warmaster has ever been able to do the same. Abaddon is the personification of the power of Chaos, the ultimate prodigal son whose return will one day bring the apocalypse to the Imperium of Man.
 Whilst his rival Traitor Legions struggle amongst themselves for the fickle favour of their chosen gods, Abaddon has a purity of purpose that all have come to respect. Under his banners march twisted Chaos Space Marines from every Traitor Legion, Renegade Chapters that have defected from the post-Heresy Imperium, hordes of Chaos Cultists, beast-headed mutants, Abhumans, Space Marines who have given their bodies to possession by daemons, war engines from the Soul Forge and a thousand other freakish strains of anarchist and monster. The denizens of the Eye of Terror have learned over the millennia that those who swear an oath of fealty to the Despoiler would do well not to break it.
 When the World Eaters that had promised their aid to Abaddon left his armies to join the fighting upon Skalathrax, the Warmaster abandoned his plans, tracked the Berzerkers down and severed their limbs before cauterising their wounds with a Flamer, leaving them as little more than screaming stumps unworthy of a place at the Blood God's table. When the Emperor's Children that had joined the Black Legion turned upon their masters at Faeruthia he blinded and deafened them to a man, tearing out their tongues and sealing them in inert gel-skin so their sensory deprivation was complete. Upon the crystal planet of Liolonac the Sorcerers of the Thousand Sons denied Abaddon the audience they had promised him, having found a Chaotic relic of unsurpassed value. The Warmaster visited a mutagenic plague upon them that twisted them into bulging repulsive mounds of flesh before lobotomising them and hunting them until death with a pack of warped, daemonic hounds.
 Abaddon's vengeance is not limited to his brother Traitors. When a wilderness shrine upon Plutol refused to bow to his authority, Abaddon killed every other human upon the planet before personally visiting the shrine and forcing the priests who maintained it to eat the bodies of those they had once prayed for. Such is the magnitude and thoroughness of each act of revenge that even daemons fear to cross Abaddon. In his singleminded quest to bring the galaxy to heel he earned a new name; the Despoiler, he who would stop at nothing to secure his revenge against the Corpse-Emperor.
 Abaddon is possibly the most powerful still-mortal individual in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Abaddon is a powerful warrior of immense strength and skill who is armed with a deadly array of both Chaos artefacts and abilities that make him an overpowering foe to face on the battlefield. Abaddon bares the Mark of Chaos Ascendant, which bestows all the benefits of the four other Marks of the Chaos Gods, forever branding him as the greatest Champion of Chaos Undivided. 
 He is also described as a demagogue, able to sway other followers of Chaos to his cause against the Imperium despite their natural inclination towards internecine conflict. Abaddon's extraordinary connection to all four of the major Chaos Gods and multiple arcane layers of Daemonic protection means that he cannot be killed outright by anything in the purely physical world, even direct fire from a super-heavy tank such as a Baneblade or a Land Raider. 
 Like his predecessor Horus, only the power of the Warp, harnessed by a psyker of immense power and undoubted purity of mind and heart, will be able to slay Abaddon the Despoiler for all time and forever place his soul beyond the capabilities of even the Ruinous Powers to resurrect.
 Abaddon is known to bear the following weapons into battle:
 Abaddon (also known as Abaddan, Apollyon, Appolyon and Appolion) literally meaning ""destruction,"" ""ruin"" or ""perdition"" -- is the Hebrew name of the demon identified as the ""angel"" of the bottomless pit, or the abyss, in the Christian Bible in the Book of Revelation of St. John; Revelation 9:11.
 Abaddon has also earned the nickname ""Failbaddon"" by Warhammer 40,000 fans, due to his many failed Black Crusades -- until the last one.
"
Eldrad Ulthran,"Eldrad Ulthran is the mightiest and most ancient Farseer of the Asuryani's Ulthwé craftworld. He is perhaps the most gifted psyker ever born amongst the Aeldari after the Fall, his incredible foresight having saved many thousands of Asuryani lives. 
 Before the Fall of Cadia in ca. 999.M41 during the 13th Black Crusade, Eldrad was already over 10,000 Terran years old.
 Among Eldrad's accomplishments are supposedly: igniting the Second War for Armageddon so as to spare the precious lives of 10,000 Asuryani, igniting the Sanapan Scouring, the Mortis Annihilation and the Third Coming of Orian, as well as an attempt to warn the Imperium of Man of Horus' treachery even before the Horus Heresy had begun. 
 Ulthran was responsible for warning the Asuryani of Iyanden of the coming of Hive Fleet Kraken and partially awakening the Aeldari god of the dead Ynnead during the Battle of Port Demesnus. 
 This latter deed led directly to the Night of Revelations in Commorragh and the birth of the Ynnari faction, which Ulthran staunchly supports as he believes they represent his species' only chance for salvation against the predations of Slaanesh.
 Ulthran created and carries into battle the Staff of Ulthamar, and his resilience and power has been a rallying point for the declining Aeldari people.
 Long ago, at the end of the Great Crusade, it was Eldrad who was the first to try and warn the Imperium of Man of the Warmaster Horus' treachery. However, it was the primarch of the Emperor's Children Legion Fulgrim he warned, and not the Emperor of Mankind, only later discovering during their meeting on the Aeldari Maiden World of Tarsus that he had made a terrible mistake and that Fulgrim had already been corrupted by exposure to a Greater Daemon of Slaanesh. 
 It was through Eldrad's foresight that the Asuryani began a series of raids against several worlds controlled by the Orks, culminating in the emergence of Ghazghkull Thraka as perhaps the most powerful Ork Warlord in the galaxy, and the diversion of his WAAAGH! to the Hive World of Armageddon, rather than allowing the Orks to move against the craftworlds. 
 Eldrad deliberately instigated the conflict that ultimately became the Second War for Armageddon, costing the Imperium millions of Human lives, to save 10,000 Asuryani lives. 
 Eldrad believed that such a sacrifice was justified since the Aeldari were a nearly extinct species and every Aeldari life was more precious than the teeming trillions of Humans who still inhabited the galaxy. 
 Had it not been for his warning, the Iyanden craftworld would have been completely unprepared for the attack of Hive Fleet Kraken.
 Eldrad's predictions were also instrumental in the closing of the Warp rift above the Aeldari Exodite world of Haran. For many solar months, massed Asuryani forces, joined by the mighty Phoenix Lord Aspect heroes and led by Eldrad prosecuted a great campaign against the forces of Chaos. 
 Eventually they succeeded in closing the Warp rift, but at the cost of many Asuryani lives. This has led to the planet being known as Haranshemash, meaning ""the world of blood and tears"" in the Aeldari Lexicon.
 On the world of Andante IV, Abaddon the Despoiler engineered a meeting between himself and Ulthran by attacking a Webway gate leading to Ulthwé. His ultimate aim was to wipe out the Seer Council, and many Asuryani deaths came in the battle that lead to Ulthran and Abaddon's meeting in combat. Abaddon ultimately escaped.
 The Treachery of Vision is a series of texts written by Farseer Eldrad Ulthran of Craftworld Ulthwé. These writings spoke of the beginning of existence and how the universe had formed. Within these texts, Ulthran also spoke of the Old Ones as well as their War in Heaven with the ancient enemy which had emerged from the hearts of a thousand suns. 
 As such, it spoke of the time when the C'tan were given physical form and how they waged a war against the Old Ones. In addition, it spoke of how the Old Ones drew power from the raw Immaterium to combat this foe. According to The Treachery of Vision, Ulthran postulated that it was during that ancient conflict between the C'tan and Old Ones which led to the formation of Daemons. 
 He also mentioned that he had heard that there were Aeldari more ancient than Asurmen who were born during this time and fed on the power of the Warp drawn by the Old Ones. This text also spoke of the Black Library and how the most ancient of knowledge was being guarded by the Harlequins who bear an imprint of the Old Ones themselves. 
 Ulthran wrote that he had seen those texts and noted that they were exquisite. Ulthran spoke of how if the ancient enemy (the Necrons) returned, than their return would signal the completion of their Great Work which would seal the Warp itself and that the Sons of Asuryan would be cut off from their life source. 
 Furthermore, the Eye of Isha would dim and close, thus ending the great legacy of the Old Ones. This is because the ancient enemy possessed no souls and thus had little to fear from the severing of the connections between the Materium and the Immaterium that tied all of reality together. 
 The Farseer also wrote of how the Aeldari species' deep well of desire had first brought the manifestation of Daemons into the physical universe.
 Eldrad has supreme mastery over the psychic arts. Like all his Farseer kin, he can read the future by casting wraithbone runes, communicate telepathically across huge distances, and enter visionary trances that allow him to observe the galaxy without moving a muscle. 
 In battle, he can melt the minds of those who cross him, summon eldritch blasts of psychic energy, and even telekinetically hurl aside war machines with a pulse of thought. To Eldrad, such crude displays of power are last resorts.
 He is a master in the arts of manipulation, so adept at tipping the scales of destiny that he can influence the course of fate with a single death, just as a master fencer kills with a single thrust. 
 He has used his precognitive powers to save the Asuryani craftworlds from extinction on numerous occasions. Once, he even used his prescience in an attempt to save the Humans of the newborn Imperium from the agonies of the Horus Heresy -- though his warnings fell on the deaf ears of the already corrupted Primarch Fulgrim.
 In the original version of the 13th Black Crusade storyline, Eldrad Ulthran suffered a far darker fate. He was believed by most Asuryani and Humans to have perished during the Cadian campaign of the 13th Black Crusade, when he was caught upon a daemonically-possessed Blackstone Fortress, or ""Talisman of Vaul"" as these ancient artefacts of the Old Ones were known to the Aeldari. 
 Eldrad had sought to stop the fortress from destroying the vitally important Imperial world of Cadia, a planet that was covered in ancient Necron monoliths called the Cadian Pylons that calmed the raging Warp Storms of the Eye of Terror and kept them from spreading, potentially destroying several Asuryani craftworlds that orbited the giant Warp rift.
 As he attempted to commune with and stop the corrupted spirit of the fortress, the Farseer learned that no minor daemonic power had corrupted the machine; the deed had been done by the psyche of the Chaos God Slaanesh itself. 
 In vain, Eldrad tried to disengage his mind from the battle with the fortress' possessing spirit. But Slaanesh proved too strong and his soul was dragged screaming into the dark core of the fortress by the Aeldari's Great Enemy. 
 Yet a flicker of hope remained for Ulthran. After the noble Asuryani's soul was believed lost to Slaanesh, all but a handful of his hundreds of Waystones became lifeless and dull. 
 Yet if just one of the Spirit Stones retained its spark, Eldrad's soul endured whole somewhere within the Realm of Chaos, seeking its freedom -- or rescue.
 This story has now been wholly superceded by the 2017 ""Gathering Storm"" story line which retconned the 13th Black Crusade and made Eldrad Ulthran a key player in the awakening of the Aeldari god of the dead, Ynnead and the birth of the Aeldari Ynnari faction.
"
Ghazghkull,"Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka (usually shortened to Ghazghkull Thraka) is an Ork warlord of the Goff klan and a mighty prophet of the WAAAGH!. He is the single most influential Ork in the galaxy in the 41st Millennium, and billions of Greenskins march to war in his name. 
 Since Ghazghkull's rise to power, he has led countless campaigns of destruction. He has crushed Aeldari war hosts, banished tides of Daemons, and smashed phalanxes of Necrons to so much sparking scrap. 
 Yet his greatest battles have always been fought against the servants of the Emperor of Mankind. Ghazghkull's sheer, unstoppable brutality has left countless worlds of the Imperium blazing in his wake and reduced the mighty Hive World of Armageddon, during the Second and Third War for Armageddon, to a never-ending cauldron of bloody battle.
 Yet Ghazghkull is not satisfied. The Ork gods Gork and Mork have greater plans for their prophet, plans they see fit to deliver amid agonising visions of a galaxy ablaze with green fire. At their behest, Ghazghkull is beginning his greatest work. 
 He will travel the galaxy, subjugating every other warlord and warboss and gathering every Ork to his banner until the stars themselves shudder to the thundering footfalls of his horde. Ghazghkull is gathering the Great WAAAGH! of Gork and Mork themselves, a WAAAGH! that will drown the galaxy in a war so great that the Greenskin gods themselves will tear their way out of the Warp to join the fight. 
 Ghazghkull's greatest nemesis in this fight is the Imperial Commissar Yarrick.
 In the 41st Millennium, and throughout all history, the brutal Orks have often been underestimated by the other powerful starfaring species in the galaxy. While all have learned to fear the destructive might of the Greenskins' migratory crusades, these are seen as temporary events. 
 They sweep across a few star systems before stalling, their tide of advance ebbing and ultimately receding so that they become little more than a footnote in the history of some other race.
 However, the WAAAGH! led by Ghazghkull Thraka is different, for this Warboss is the most dangerous Ork alive. His mighty green crusade is no mere planet crusher, but an invasion that will shake the foundations of the galaxy in a war for total domination. 
 As a species, Orks are not bound by history -- they neither revere the past, nor record it in any manner. Greenskins are creatures that live in, and for, the here and now. What makes the Ork whose full name is Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka so dangerous, is that he has vision -- not just for the present, but for the past, and most importantly, for the future. 
 After all, he is no mere Ork, but rather the living prophet of the Ork gods Gork and Mork. Ghazghkull is their mighty instrument of destruction made manifest.
 At the close of the 41st Millennium, the name of Ghazghkull is spoken in fearful whispers in many alien languages, a name synonymous with dread across the galaxy. It was not always so -- the greatest Ork Warlord in history began his climb to infamy as just another Ork warrior slogging it out on a backwater world. 
 At the very edge of Segmentum Solar lies a now-frozen orb that was once the sporadically populated Ork planet of Urk. Its history has been largely forgotten, buried beneath successive invasions, but it was first named Urokleas, after it was founded by an exploration fleet launched from Terra during the Dark Age of Technology.
 It was part of the Zornian System, and the tides of the Warp flowed strongly to that point, making it an excellent hub. Humanity prospered on Urokleas, for it was a world rich in minerals, and within a few hundred Terran years the colonies had grown to thriving cities and busy spaceports. 
 It was, undoubtedly, the lights and activity that drew the Orks. They swept across Urokleas like wildfire. They razed it to the ground before disappearing aboard their great junk fleet, riding the Warp tides to seek other exploits. As is their way, though, the greenskins unwittingly left behind traces of their reproductive fungal spores, and one day they would rise again.
 Due to the flow of the Warp, it was inevitable that space-faring races would again find the habitable Zornian System. Between barren periods, the world became an Aeldari outpost, the home of a cluster of Spinedorians, and a Hrud warren. At times, the long-dormant Ork spores would erupt, and swarms of greenskins would develop in some secretive corner of the planet.
 It was not until the time of the Great Crusade that Mankind returned again in force. It was the Dark Angels Space Marine Legion who cleared the planet of its life forms and again planted the flag of Humanity upon it. Once more, the planet was dubbed Urokleas. 
 For over two thousand standard years, Humanity mined there, building hive cities and tethering spaceports to its twin moons. Minor xenos raids occurred, but it wasn't until near the middle of the 32nd Millennium that a great greenskin WAAAGH! swept the system in the days of the War of the Beast. 
 It was the largest recorded Ork attack upon the Imperium to that time, with dozens of invasions blazing across all five Segmentums. Soon the Zornian System fell into Ork hands. As Urokleas was overwhelmed by greenskins, the last survivors of that world boarded the vast star freighter Dominion and escaped into the suddenly shifting Warp.
 The tides of the Warp had altered, making the Zornian System no longer easily accessible. Thus began a long period of stagnation for the Orks. For nearly eight thousand standard years Urokleas, renamed Urk, was a battleground for warring greenskin tribes. 
 At first they fought over the ruins of the Human hive cities, clashing over the best loot. These battles devolved, as did the piles of plunder they fought over. As the millennia ground on, the wars continued. 
 No leader proved large enough to gather more than a handful of the tribes or klanz beneath him, so an equilibrium of squalor became the way of life. Small Ork warbands fought each other for possession of an ever-dwindling pile of scrap iron and derelict machinery. It was into this bleak cycle of futile violence that Ghazghkull was born.
 In a curious twist of fate, the Imperium of Man may have had an unsuspecting hand in creating the most formidable Ork of his era, and perhaps of all time. After many Terran years of fighting Orks and monitoring their presence in outlying systems, the Imperium had learned that, under the right conditions, even sporadic Ork populations could multiply with startling speed.
 The rise of a strong Warlord could unite the feuding klanz, triggering a mass release of spores. Should this gathering grow large enough, it would act as a psychic beacon to Orks on nearby planets -- drawing them into a swarming migration that built with frightening intensity. In less than a Terran decade, Orks could go from being a minor nuisance to the world's dominant species.
 The Imperium has found that if a rising WAAAGH! can be detected and countered early enough, the Orks can be broken and dispersed at little cost. Thus, in star systems known to be plagued with greenskins, various watchposts are deployed. In the Zornian System the Dark Angels had established a range of monitoring stations coordinated by a command sanctum in a barren mountainous region of Urk.
 This hub routinely fed scans and other information back to the nearest Dark Angels vessels. In this way, the greenskin numbers were regularly checked and the Dark Angels could also keep track of the feral human populations of that star system -- for they were always searching for new recruiting planets from which they could draw battle-tested warriors. Ironically, it was this very monitoring station that set Ghazghkull on his journey to greatness.
 The first mention of Ghazghkull came some nine Terran years before the Second War for Armageddon in 932.M41. The stripling warrior Ghazghkull was a trooper in a Goff klan warband that took part in a raid upon the Space Marines' command sanctum. Although it was hidden atop a remote mountain crag on Urk, it was not safe from the Orks. Always seeking a scrap, the greenskins discovered the hidden base and sought to dismantle it, triggering the base's auto-defence system.
 During the initial rush to claim the base, Ghazghkull was hit in the head by a Bolter shell -- a shot that pulverised a large section of his cranium and turned a sizable portion of his brain to absolute mush. It was quite possible that the young and profusely bleeding Ghazghkull might have been left for dead then and there but for two circumstances.
 Ghazghkull got back to his feet -- a sign of toughness and grit that any Goff respected. Also, it was widely known that a particularly addled Deathskulls Painboy was paying those who brought him fresh material to work with. The carrion birds did not feed on Ghazghkull that day, as his own mob guided him onwards. He was a stumbling wreck and had to hold his bleeding brains in with both hands, but they eventually reached the Deathskulls' outpost of Rustspike. There, his own mob traded Ghazghkull to Mad Dok Grotsnik for the sum total of three teef and a new Choppa.
 Ghazghkull came out of his haze immediately after Mad Dok Grotsnik performed his pivotal operation. That he awoke was a surprise to both parties, for Grotsnik had replaced part of the Goff warrior's skull and brain with bioniks, wires, and Squig sinew -- holding it all in place by riveting on adamantium plates. More amazement followed. Ghazghkull could see more clearly than he ever had before. This had little to do with his eyesight or new bionik eye -- which truthfully was always a bit out of focus. Rather, for the first time in his short life, Ghazghkull awoke with a brand new vision -- it was his destiny to rally all of Orkdom and to lead them on the greatest WAAAGH! of all time. It was now his belief that he was in direct contact with Gork and Mork, the Great Green Gods of the Orks, and Ghazghkull realised he had been chosen as the living embodiment of their divine wishes. They wanted him to lead the way towards the greatest battles in the galaxy.
 The first to fall beneath Ghazghkull's ironshod heel was the Deathskulls Warlord, Dregmek. Ghazghkull had just emerged from Mad Dok Grotsnik's grimy tent and was still rubbing his shiny adamantium-plated pate when Dregmek approached. Striding down the street that ran between the corrugated shacks of the derelict Deathskulls outpost, Dregmek demanded to know what a Goff was doing within the boundaries of Rustspike. Behind Dregmek, his entourage of Nobz guffawed, anticipating a bit of sport. Undaunted by the massive cobbled-together Kombi-weapon that the Deathskulls Warlord was waving in his direction, Ghazghkull advanced, knobby fists clenched. Dregmek, expecting exactly such a move from a Goff, opened fire. Every barrel of his kustom weapon began to blaze -- the air was filled with flying projectiles and the flashing of half a dozen gun muzzles emitted blinding strobes of light.
 Perhaps it was a sign from Gork (or possibly Mork), a stroke of divine intervention to save their prophet, as although explosions blossomed at his feet and bullets stitched patterns alongside him, Ghazghkull advanced untouched. The only sounds were the last of the spent shells clattering to the ground, the spinning whir of empty ammunition hoppers, a few desperate trigger clicks, the heavy tread of iron boots and finally a rusty squeak as Dregmek's iron jaw fell open. So savage was the pummelling that Ghazghkull delivered with his bare hands that Dregmek's Nobz cheered despite themselves. The headbutt, delivered from Ghazghkull's newly armoured skull, finished the job with a resounding clang. Straddling the pulped body of his foe, Ghazghkull announced that this was only the beginning. He bellowed to the gaping onlookers that he was the Prophet of Gork and Mork, and, furthermore, his bull-voice roared that if anyone was looking for some of the devastation he had just delivered to their former Warlord, then they could step up one at a time or rush altogether -- he cared not. After another hour of solid fighting -- a battle in which Ghazghkull did not himself take any more damage than a scratch -- he had taken over as rightful ruler of Rustspike. Though it was hard to see much with their bruised and battered faces, it seemed to his new followers that Ghazghkull grew larger before their eyes.
 By crushing the tribes within reach of his new stronghold, Ghazghkull began to increase his horde. In addition to the Deathskulls that had followed Dregmek, there were now several Goff mobs beneath the young Warlord. As tales of Ghazghkull's deeds circulated through the scrapheap villages and makeshift fortresses of Urk, Orks began to leave their tribes and head to Rustspike, looking to be part of something bigger than their own dismal warbands, fighting over the same old scrap. They wished to go to war with this new Boss who claimed to talk to Gork and Mork, who asserted that one day they would find richer targets. Soon, Rustspike grew so overcrowded that it was impossible to spit and hit the ground, so Ghazghkull went west. It was on the cracked plains of Da Big Wasteland that Ghazghkull met his first setback. He had entered the territory of the Bad Moons, the richest and most envied of the local klanz. The Bad Moon leader was Warboss Snazzdakka, and none could match the mix of firepower and mobility that was his bright yellow Battlewagon brigade. When Snazzdakka saw Ghazghkull's hordes marching across his lands, he ordered his totem pole raised and the tents collapsed and, faster than a Runtherd could throttle a wayward Grot, the tribe was on the move. In the running skirmishes that followed, Snazzdakka and his Boyz were always able to lob a few shells into Ghazghkull's hordes before driving off out of range of retaliation.
 Ghazghkull had already proven his superior brawling skills by overpowering, bludgeoning and working over all who dared challenge or defy him. Now, however, he was engaged in a battle of wits and tactics. Here too, the up-and-coming Warlord would display not just his superiority, but the kind of brutal showmanship that makes Orks punch their fists into the air and raise raucous cheers. Within days, Ghazghkull unleashed a number of countermeasures -- any one of which would have proved too much for the Bad Moons to overcome. He had his ladz sabotage the supply dumps where Snazzdakka refuelled his Battlewagons. Ghazghkull then gauged the wind and ordered several shantytowns put to the flame. The thick, acrid smoke drifted over the cracked plains, hiding the exact whereabouts of his troops' movements and making it impossible for the Bad Moons to flee until Ghazghkull's infantry was right on top of them. Most impressively, Ghazghkull had coerced the fastest Ork on Urk to join him by out-racing him in a one-on-one duel of speed. All who saw it agreed that only the divine might of Gork and Mork could have allowed the now hulking Goff Warlord to outpace Grand Speedboss Shazfrag of the Evil Sunz.
 Each and every one of Ghazghkull's tactics worked, wearing down the Bad Moons so that their defeat was inevitable. As the humbled Snazzdakka watched, Ghazghkull ordered the Bad Moon Meks to fashion an enormous Power Klaw  from the rubble of their ruined tanks. So did all the Bad Moons on the planet fall into line. So large had Ghazghkull's horde grown that no warband on Urk could hope to stand before his sweeping onslaught. Only the foolish or the stubborn even attempted to stand apart from the meteoric rise of this great greenskin champion. One such stubborn fool was Snakebite Warboss Grudbolg. It took a long, bloody solar week to subdue the Snakebites under Grudbolg, and Ghazghkull was forced to decapitate the scarred old monster twice before finally winning his loyalty. When challenged to a headbutting contest by the hulking Goff champion, Ugrak, Ghazghkull was like a piledriver, sinking his foe a full foot into the ground and knocking him unconscious. Ugrak's Nobz mob was so stunned that their undefeated leader had lost that they did not see Ghazghkull striding towards them. In a fury, Ghazghkull worked his way through the Nobz, leaving each senseless. When the heads of Ugrak and his Nobz finally cleared, they quite sensibly pledged eternal allegiance to Ghazghkull. Battles of attrition had raged across the surface of Urk for nearly eight thousand Terran years, with small tribes continually rising and falling, each time battering themselves and those around them into submission. No great leader had ever emerged from the endless cycle; over all that time, none could unite the tribes. Until now...
 It took six standard years for Ghazghkull to fully subjugate Urk. Now grown larger than any Warlord ever seen on the planet, he basked in his domination. Inspired by the spirits of the rising WAAAGH! and Ghazghkull's impassioned speeches about conquering the stars, the Orks swarmed about the planet's surface in a flurry of activity. A smattering of ramshackle voidships begin to arrive, as Orks from across the Zornian System felt the siren call of a WAAAGH! and hastened to join. For the first time, groups of Meks worked together, building in ways never contemplated before. Never before had they been able to mass their squalid resources, but now all of the scrapheaps were as one. Crazed energies flowed as they cobbled together vast battle fortresses, new weapons and towering engines of destruction. All of Urk's greenskins moved with a sense of destiny, an overwhelming realisation of their duty, their very purpose for being -- and then the sun flickered. All the greenskins looked up at the suddenly dimmed sun that had always lit the planet of Urk. All save Ghazghkull himself were cowed. The superstitious Orks dropped their weapons and spanners and stared upwards, slack-jawed in wonder at the celestial phenomenon. The sun flared, blazed -- and once more, its rays blinked.
 In his booming voice, Ghazghkull assured the quavering greenskins that this was a sign from Gork and Mork. It was telling them that it was time to leave Urk behind, that it was time for the galaxy to feel the might of the growing WAAAGH!. Even as the Warlord spoke, a lone beam of green-tinted light illuminated the Prophet of the Great Green Gods. He told his followers to stockpile all the arms and ammunition they could, for they were leaving within the week. As there were few operating aircraft upon Urk, and the Meks had only just started to construct more, some greenskins wondered how this might happen. A single glare from Ghazghkull, however, was enough to silence their questions and instil in them, if not confidence, then at least a fear of asking how any such thing might be accomplished. The next day brought no dawn. In this case, however, it was nothing to do with the strange behaviour of Urk's sun. The Warp currents had changed again, reverting to patterns similar to those of ages ago. As the tides of the Warp roiled and twisted, they had also deposited an enormous space hulk into realspace, vomiting forth the conglomerate voidcraft in the Zornian System. The Hulk now drifted in Urk's orbit, blocking out the light from the flickering sun.
 As solar flares and radiation storms wafted from Urk's tortured sun, Ghazghkull turned to his Meks and bade them secure the space hulk using super-heavy Traktor Kannons. A few of the available spacecraft were equipped with harpoon rockets, and they fired these off to tether the colossal Space Hulk to one of Urk's twin moons. For the moment, the space hulk was pinned -- but all knew it would not be so for long. Under Ghazghkull's orders, the remaining Orks rushed to assist the Meks. They worked non-stop to craft as many crude transport ships as they could. There were perhaps one hundred constructions worthy of being called ships, while other craft were built to complete only a single journey. There were many hundreds of these crude rockets, each incapable of being steered, each with Orks and equipment wedged into every hold and crawlspace. Boarding the largest of this crude fleet, Ghazghkull led the great exodus from the planet to seize the space hulk. With exhaust flashes and more than their share of premature detonations and mid-air collisions, the departing voidcraft filled the sky. Some ships struck the space hulk's outer decks and detonated to blow gaping holes into the superstructure. A few rockets ploughed deep into the hulk to deposit their Ork cargo, while the most sturdily constructed ships actually had the wherewithal to fly about the vast space hulk to seek out landing sites -- or, at the least, to enter the vast Hulk through the massive holes blown into it by the less fortunate Ork rockets.
 Alas, as is so often the case, the space hulk was not unoccupied. As soon as the first wave of Orks landed they were attacked by daemonic entities. Burna Boyz, cutting their way through bulkheads, had to suddenly shift from slicing metal to defending themselves against a tide of Daemons. Gouts of dirty orange flame were met in kind by arcane blue jets, as the Burna Boyz traded scorching death with prancing Pink Horrors. Before their ships had even settled, Speed Freeks launched themselves from cargo ramps, racing down cavernous corridors, guns blazing. Less than half of the Ork spacecraft were able to lift off once again, but these disengaged in order to go back to Urk's surface to ferry more greenskins into the battle. The fighting took solar weeks, during which time billions of greenskins were airlifted off Urk to join the fray.
 Ghazghkull himself led the spearhead that fought its way to the centre of the space hulk. There, at the black heart of the jumbled amalgamation, was an ancient voidcraft -- none other than the vast star freighter Dominion. After leaving Urk -- then called Urokleas -- to escape the Ork attack, the voidcraft became lost in the Warp, its terrified human cargo attracting the horrific creatures that dwelled there. The Dominion had returned home, but where its Warp engines had once been located there was now a huge Warp rift -– a darksome hole from which the energies of the Immaterium poured forth. The fight to take over the Daemon-held space hulk was a bitter battle through ever-changing confines. Neither side showed mercy, hacking at each other in the narrow corridors and turning vast cargo bays into slaughter-pits where entire armies crashed headlong. Now and again, newcomers would join the fight -- a fresh tide of Daemons sweeping from the space hulk's centre, or an Ork rocket crashing through to deliver its living payload. Slowly, the Orks drove the Daemon host back, but at every junction lay an ambush and casualties were high.
 It was Mad Dok Grotsnik who led a charge to win the landing bays of what must have been an old Imperial transport. The landing craft berthed within were still occupied by the skeletons of their long-dead pilots. The few landing craft that were still operational were commandeered to aid the transport efforts. It was Ugrak's Uglies -– the Goff Nobz Mob –- that fought their way into the asteroid embedded deep within the space hulk. There, in magma-worn tunnels, they pitted Power Klaws against Hellblades, and in the end only Ugrak's Kombi-skorcha swept the path clear. In the larger holds, Battlewagons lowered their deff rollas to mash all opposition, before being countered by Soul Grinders -- hulking Daemon Engines whose metal claws shredded the Ork vehicles. Soon, Ork Tankbustas were hunting the Soul Grinders, crawling through air vents to send rokkits corkscrewing into their unnatural foes, blowing them apart in sprays of flame and ichor. Behind the front waves of fighting came the Meks, welding over patches, re-sealing airlocks and repairing their battered engines of war.
 Having driven the daemonic hosts before him, Ghazghkull ordered the massed firepower of his entourage to be turned against the tear in reality. To his frustration, this did nothing to it. With a bestial roar, and leaking raw green energy from his reconstructed skull, Ghazghkull charged the rent. To further anger the Warlord, his Power Klaw proved equally ineffectual and, with an almighty challenge, Ghazghkull unleashed the full thunder of his best headbutt. There was a flash of green, an audible pop, and, at last, the rift collapsed upon itself. Whether it was the force of that blow, or the latent psychic energy within Ghazghkull, it was done, and the Daemon threat ended -- at least for a time. The space hulk, which Ghazghkull named Wurld Killa, was now in Ork control. Just as superheated gas clouds swept over Urk, Wurld Killa shifted back into the Warp.
 How long Ghazghkull and his followers drifted in the Warp is not known. Time passes strangely there, and Orks keep no records. They explored the bounds of the vast space hulk, finding strange technology -- ancient machines from Humanity's lost past and other apparatus beyond their comprehension. For some, especially the Deathskulls, this meandering search including nicking everything not bolted down. As they worked alongside Burna Boyz whose arc-welders cut through metal, the Orks were able to appropriate everything, no matter how well fastened it was. On Ghazghkull's command, many Meks began working on a force field projector. Meanwhile, competing warbands fought to gather scrap and minor wars broke out over salvage rights. This rivalry kept tensions at just the right level to prevent the volatile Orks from growing too bored. Sheets of iron decking were reworked into Battlewagons, used to ""plate up"" Stompas, or beaten into crude body armour to outfit Nobz. In the mad furore to claim metal, several warbands were swept into the Warp when they overstretched their boundaries and cut away sections of the space hulk's outermost walls.
 It was this kind of foolishness that allowed Warp entities to re-enter Wurld Killa. Several more daemonic incursions plagued the journey, and Ghazghkull had to drive out the worst of these Warp offensives personally. With vicious battles breaking out across the space hulk, there was an abundance of violent WAAAGH! energy, and the Orks thrived and multiplied. Soon, every cranny of the voidcraft was bursting with more greenskins. Everywhere, swarms of Grots scurried; the halls rang to the sound of chants, Shoota blasts, and the commands of the ever-busy Meks. Gradually, the Daemon tides ebbed; the jubilant Orks were beginning to get restless when sudden jolts alerted all that the lumbering space hulk was slowing down. With gut-lurching suddenness, Wurld Killa ripped back into realspace. What had been an empty void was now filled with the massive space hulk. Aboard the sprawling vessel, klaxons blared and Ghazghkull's voice boomed out of speakers and down corridors, telling all to prepare for battle. Like a tidal wave, the momentum of Wurld Killa sent the space hulk crashing forward. It smashed aside defence stations while panicked picket-ships accelerated to get out of the path of the hurtling wall of space junk.
 In 941.M41, the Orks emerged at the edge of a star system vital to the Imperium, heading straight for the core planet. Before them sprawled the immensity that was Armageddon -- an industrial giant of Mankind's realm. The planet lay roughly ten thousand light years to the galactic northeast of Terra in the Segmentum Solar. It was a vital node of navigational channels, and its countless manufactorums supplied munitions to Astra Militarum regiments throughout the Armageddon Sector and beyond. No force in the galaxy could now stop Wurld Killa from crash-landing onto Armageddon. Guided by his visions, Ghazghkull did not wish to halt his flight; rather, he welcomed the headlong plunge towards the world below. The acceleration built, and he bellowed joyous war cries as the hull blazed with fire and the hulk thundered down from Armageddon's sky like a scrap-iron avalanche. Up until this point, Ghazghkull had only made a name for himself on Urk -– a little known and soon-to-be dead star system. Soon, however, his name would send ripples of fear across hundreds of thousands of worlds. Now, Ghazghkull was on a collision course with greatness.
 Surrounding Imperial fleets, long-ranged missiles and the planet's orbital defence lasers did their best to stave off the inevitable. Their firepower managed to shear away a few chunks of the oncoming space hulk, but they could not stop the terminal dive of Wurld Killa, nor could they alter its course. Although shorn of a good deal of its mass by the desperate salvoes, the enormous space hulk plunged through Armageddon's polluted atmosphere to crash-land upon its largest continent, Armageddon Prime. The deep impact of the landing shook the entire world, and its blast wave caused untold devastation. A cloud of debris shrouded the sun. Hundreds of thousands of Orks were instantly immolated by the cataclysmic contact of the landing. Their losses, however, were but a tiny fraction of their number.
 As the shock faded, a few of the Orks realised that they should all have died in that epic crash. Ghazghkull claimed it was the protection of the gods, although the force field projector absorbing the brunt of that impact doubtlessly helped. Regardless, the Orks roared their approval at being alive after the exhilarating ride. Eager to release their pent-up aggression, they poured out of drop ramps or simply blasted new exit holes through the already torn and rent ruins of the remaining hulls. Ghazghkull divided his followers into five distinct hordes, each under one of his most powerful Warlords. These were leaders Ghazghkull had subdued upon Urk, ferocious Orks that had learned by fighting alongside him. Under the dust storm's darkness, the towering WAAAGH! overlord pointed out the direction each of his sub-commanders should take. With a wave of his Power Klaw, Ghazghkull launched endless columns of Ork war machines and living seas of green-skinned infantry. With one voice, many millions bellowed.
 The defenders of Armageddon were not ready for what hit them. The Astra Militarum and the Planetary Defence Forces of Armageddon may have been well-equipped, but they were wholly unprepared for the waves of violence that swept over their armies. It was clear that the humans underestimated the strategic ability of their foes. They had fought Orks before, but these greenskins were different; this was not some petty Warlord's formulaic assault –- this was WAAAGH! Ghazghkull.
 Although none of his sub-commanders displayed the sheer audacity and cunning of their master, Ghazghkull had beat enough into their skulls about tactics for some of it to stick. They easily overwhelmed the Planetary Defence Force legions that advanced out of the planet's hive cities to contain them. First, the Orks launched assaults to pin the foe in place on the flat ash wastes, while biker mobs and Battlewagon brigades raced around to encircle their foes, cutting off their supply lines. Then the greenskins tightened the noose. They set up their Mek Gun batteries to pummel the panicked defenders left in the ever-shrinking cauldron. Desperate attempts to break out were met by gunlines. Mercilessly, the Orks mowed down anything that moved, guffawing at the lines of 'umies that advanced to meet only death, aping their final curses as they twitched their last upon the bloodstained ash.
 With the plains cleared, the Orks advanced on the hive cities and there they were astounded. Built atop sprawling ashblown desert wastes, the hives rose up taller than mountains. These were the great factory-cities of the Imperium, the lifeblood of its non-stop war efforts. This was industrial might on a scale never before seen by the Orks. The Meks gazed at the hives with joy, imagining how they could repurpose such works, what they could build with such colossal hoards of materiel.
 The Imperium's defence of the hives proved more formidable. The Astra Militarum's numbers were augmented by every regiment available, along with hastily-armed citizens. A long series of trenches and redoubts encircled each vast walled complex. Ghazghkull took one look at Hive Volcanus before vowing boldly that it would fall in two solar days' time. Although his hordes were numerous enough to overwhelm the gates, Ghazghkull did not want to waste his strength. He had yet to unleash the full terror of his Gargant Big Mobs, but he thought that prodigious firepower should be saved for when it was truly required. Instead, his plan to take the enormous factory-city reflected his cunning. It was simple, it just needed flawless execution and seamless cooperation -- a tall order for a typical WAAAGH!-leader, but not so for Ghazghkull.
 The outer barriers were targeted by Blitz Brigades -- armoured wedges of Battlewagons. The first wave bore rams, and it was their duty to break open the outer walls, using their tracks to carry them over the rubble. The second group of attackers followed in the wake of the smoke-churning Ork Battlewagons; these were the mobile infantry -- mostly Goff Boyz, with mobs of Burna Boyz amongst them. The third wave was composed of Skorchas -- their orders were to drive through the breaches and to clear any defences with sweeping flame. Traktor beams would target the gates as the Battlewagons cleared the last trench. Timed correctly, the loaded wagons would be at top speed just as the doors were ripped off their hinges. Secondary plans included a Stormboyz airdrop and Stompas with wrecking balls opening up holes at strategic points. When the waves of infantry were finally released, they could enter Volcanus at will.
 The plan worked almost too well. The hive would have fallen in a single solar day were it not for its fierce resistance. Within the narrow confines of the hive's underways, desperate humans resorted to all manner of traps and ambushes. Despite their heroics, hundreds of thousands of Orks swept into Hive Volcanus, and its population was massacred or enslaved. After Hive Volcanus was captured, the remaining hives of Armageddon Prime soon followed. Columns of human refugees stretched past the horizon. All of Armageddon Prime lay under the massive metal heel of Ghazghkull. What were once manufactoria were converted to workshops swarming with Orks. Human slaves were worked to death stripping their own cities of every scrap of resource that the Meks could use to fuel the greenskin war machine. The WAAAGH! proceeded southwards towards the heavily populated continent of Armageddon Secundus.
 Being somewhat soft, it is extraordinary for 'umies to gain respect from Orks -- especially greenskins led by a stoic and battle-hungry Goff like Ghazghkull. Although Space Marines are regarded with esteem for their skills in battle -- none more so than Commander Dante of the Blood Angels -- it was an Imperial Commissar that drew the most admiration from the Orks. Here was an uncompromising warrior –- as eager to shoot his own ladz as the foe, if that's what it took to gain victory. Commissar Sebastian Yarrick was certainly a thorn in Ghazghkull's side, for the greenskins reckon that it was he alone that willed the defenders of Hades Hive to hold on for so long.
 The Orks gradually learned from their captives that the defenders of Hades had grown to fear Yarrick as much as they dreaded the fury of Ghazghkull. To the Orks, this was the kind of leader they could respect. The fact that he wore Goff colours -- black with red trim -- boosted his esteem even further. It is said that of all Ghazghkull's foes, Yarrick was the only one that he ever cursed -- high praise indeed. Those Orks that came face-to-face with the infamous ""'Umie Boss"" often expressed disappointment. In person, Yarrick was only human-sized, although this was lessened somewhat because he did at least wear an Ork Power Klaw and bear an evil eye. Amongst the Boyz, it was said that those Orks that recognised who they were up against were always slain -– for they stood in gape-jawed disbelief at Yarrick's insulting puniness and so left themselves open to a deathblow. The wily Orks acknowledged the value of this tactic, even if it was a sly, sneaky Blood Axe kind of trick.
 When Armageddon's Season of Shadows set in -- the cyclical time when the planet's volcanic mountains erupted -- the turbulent skies were permanently crimson-hued. To the Orks, this was another sign of their impending victory. To get to Armageddon Secundus the Orks had to cross a swathe of equatorial jungle considered impenetrable by the humans. The foetid swamp region was a morass of mudpits that could submerge armies at a time, and it was filled with ferocious wild beasts. The greenskins revelled in it, attacking the flora and fauna while the Meks erected pontoon bridges or projected force fields across the sinking bogs. By their drive and cobbled ingenuity, the Ork hordes pressed through faster than Imperial armies could march.
 Infantry, armoured columns, Stompa Mobs and towering Gargants crossed the crude bridges and emerged on the far side of the jungles. Once again the Orks caught the humans unprepared and smashed through their defensive positions. As the Orks raced across the ash deserts towards the hive cities, the towering god-engines and tank companies of Mankind advanced out into the barrens to meet them. From that point on, the battles were more fiercely fought, and Ork casualties began to mount. First was the clash on the parched desert known as the Death Barrens. While the colossal war engines of the Iron Skulls Titan Legion duelled with the Gargants, the massed enemy tanks began to blow great holes in the Ork hordes. The greenskins did not waver, but continued to advance, albeit more slowly, into that thunderous barrage. The energies of the WAAAGH! might have been drained then and there were it not for the Dread Mobs.
 Clanking forward, these iron-plated tank-killers strode through the shellstorm. A land armada of Deff Dreads, Killa Kans and hulking Morkanauts lurched into the enemy armour formations. Explosions lit up the plains as Power Klaws wrenched off turrets. Buzzsaw arms reached in to savage the exposed crew, and the screams of the eviscerated victims were music to the Orks' ears. With the foes' tanks reduced to smoking wreckage, the Stompas and Deff Dreads used their firepower to tip the scales on the evenly matched duel between the Gargants and the Titans. Towering mushroom clouds rose from the destroyed Imperial Titans, and the concussive blasts of their detonations slew many Orks, but when the shockwaves ceased, the green tide flowed over the enormous craters.
 The sieges that followed brought the Armageddon War to a new state of savagery. By now the humans knew what lay in store for them, and their resistance stiffened. The Orks sacked Infernus Hive after the Blood Axes struck a deal with its corrupt Governor, but they could not break through the great hive cities of Hades or Helsreach. In desperation, the Imperial side launched virus bombs -- wicked and proscribed technology from their distant past. Hundreds of thousands of Orks died, but still they pressed on, battering themselves against the hive cities for little gain. With his sub-commanders flummoxed on how to break through, Ghazghkull was forced to direct the assaults himself.
 Ghazghkull tried many ploys: lightning assaults, feints, overwhelming wave attacks and massed bombardments. Air-dropped Stormboyz attacked from the skies while the sewer tunnels were infiltrated by the craftiest Kommandoz. At Helsreach, these stratagems paid off, each offensive advancing more deeply into that seaport hive city. With the streets red with blood, Ghazghkull's final tactic -- to gather the Weirdboyz together so their WAAAGH!-addled minds blasted forth a psychic storm -- worked perfectly. Paralysed by madness, the defenders were overrun. In Hades, each of Ghazghkull's moves was parried. The Stormboyz were ripped from the skies by anti-aircraft fire, the Kommandoz were met by tunnel-fighters in a running battle that stymied the underground advance. Siege engines were sabotaged and human suicide teams took down Gargants. The defence of Hades Hive was masterminded by Commissar Yarrick, who was destined to become the most respected 'umie that WAAAGH! Ghazghkull ever met.
 As Ghazghkull fixated on tearing Hades Hive apart, on his command another Ork army was set to overwhelm the hive city of Acheron. But that was before the sky exploded. Orbital bombardment blasted craters amongst the Ork hordes. Even as they gaped skyward, they saw Thunderhawks peel out of the cloud cover, the roar of their engines audible over the concussive shockwave of their bombing runs. The Space Marines -- the finest warriors in the Emperor's service -- had arrived. The Blood Angels, the Ultramarines and the Salamanders attacked, and the Orks tasted the bitterness of crushing defeat for the first time. At that moment, if Ghazghkull had turned his attention to the deteriorating situation, it is likely he could have rallied his armies and driven off the Space Marine counterattack. Had he done so, Armageddon would likely have fallen. However, the completion of the siege of Hades Hive had become an obsession. Prophet though he was, in the red haze of battle, Ghazghkull no longer heard any calling save to grind his iron boots upon those who had dared defy him. Finally, Ghazghkull's own Bullyboyz broke down the last blast door. With the inner gates now open, Ghazghkull threw everything at the hive city, unleashing his final rampage. The Space Marines arrived too late to save Hades Hive, and those inside were massacred nearly to a man.
 With his numbers depleted and widely scattered, Ghazghkull commanded the last of his reinforcements to besiege Tartarus Hive. The fate of the planet hung in the balance, but the Space Marines were quick to redeploy. A Drop Pod assault struck the Orks even as Gorkanauts and Stompas smashed down the hive's gates. Blindsided again, the greenskins were pushed back and on the verge of breaking when Ghazghkull arrived. His counterattack was just beginning to wrest the initiative back when Ghazghkull and his bodyguard disappeared altogether. Rumours that their illustrious Warboss had fallen spread like wildfire amongst the Orks, and they wavered and broke. With this, the Imperium thought they had driven the Orks from Armageddon. It was not so. Many fought their way into the ash wastes and escaped, eventually reaching the depths of the equatorial jungles. Moreover, Ghazghkull was not slain. Some say the hand of Gork reached down to extricate his chosen one. Ghazghkull's few Ork detractors claimed he had fled, but however it happened, the Warboss escaped off-planet.
 After leaving Armageddon, Ghazghkull was not idle. He did not look upon that campaign as a defeat, but more as a necessary stumble that was part of a larger journey, for a master plan had been revealed to Ghazghkull by Gork and Mork. Now, the Warlord saw clearly that Armageddon was not the end, it was only the beginning. If the Imperium made one huge mistake following the Second War for Armageddon, it was in not immediately pursuing Ghazghkull with all their strength and available resources. Yarrick recommended hunting him down, but few heeded the battle-proven Commissar. In truth, the Imperium's High Command on Armageddon presumed that the Ork Warlord that came out of nowhere to ravage their planet either was dead, or, if he had survived the battle, would be a washed-up nothing. He might live for some time as a recluse, but if he attempted to gather more Orks about him he would doubtless be slain as a failure. Nothing could be further from the truth.
 After losing a major battle, Orks will often depose their failed leader -- the first step on the downward spiral to true anarchy. It is true that, early on after his escape, Ghazghkull did have to remind some tribes of his greatness by defeating his challengers in horrific fashion. However, the Warlord regained his followers' full support not just with his triumphal acts of violence, but through his words. What the Ork gods had revealed to Ghazghkull -- or rather, what Ghazghkull said they revealed to him -- was that in order to destroy your foe, you must first know him. To the Orks, such an idea was both radical and profound. This meant that, for Ghazghkull, the whole invasion of Armageddon was merely a way to test the waters -- an experiment to learn how the Imperium would react against a massive invasion. The swift Space Marine strikes and the grinding attrition of the human warriors had indeed been eye-openers to an Ork from the isolated world of Urk. Now, Ghazghkull had learned what he needed to know about the Imperium's strategies. It was time to regroup -- to gather new armies, to rebuild and restore the WAAAGH! until it had strength enough to menace entire star systems.
 Most of Ghazghkull's forces had been left behind on Armageddon. Only a core of his most trusted mobs were with Ghazghkull when he landed in the heart of what was notorious Ork territory –- the world of Golgotha. In ages past the Golgotha Sub-sector had been heavily colonised by Mankind, but since then it had passed through the grasp of various races until it was ultimately conquered by the Orks. That WAAAGH!, however, had run out of impetus long ago –- leaving behind many disparate and inter-feuding tribes. Just like on Urk, Ghazghkull began subjugating the greenskins. At first he clubbed bosses and gained new mobs one at a time, but news travels fast when Orks begin to get excited. Whether it was due to the tremendous power of his adamantium-skull headbutts, or the Orkish wisdom he received from his visions from Gork and Mork, soon whole tribes were seeking out this new Warlord.
 During this time, Commissar Yarrick continued to pursue the renegade Ork Warlord obsessively. 
Ghazghkull proclaimed that as the chosen of Gork and Mork, he was the only one who could defeat the 'umie wiv the evil eye. Unlike his underlings, Ghazghkull was canny enough to understand that attempting to stop the pursuing humans was doomed to failure: not unlike an Ork WAAAGH!, a human Crusade thrived on strife and victory, and needed to be exhausted first. Ghazghkull achieved this by seemingly running away and remaining tantalisingly just out of reach of his pursuers, sacrificing to Yarrick those of his underlings who disobeyed or challenged him. This he did for 10 standard years until he could spring his trap on his pursuers. Luring them to the planet of Golgotha, he blinded the exhausted and over-stretched human commanders with a chance for victory over his seemingly depleted Ork forces. Unknown to the Imperium, a large space hulk had deposited a second, lesser WAAAGH! on Golgotha, which was waiting in large underground cave complexes. Ghazghkull had a base constructed that was intended to give to the Imperial attackers the impression that he was organising a last stand. The Ork Warlord went as far as to sacrifice his remaining Gargants to a pointless flanking manoeuvre, all in order to make the humans commit fully to the field against him on Golgotha. Once they did, Ghazghkull caught them between the hammer of his hidden greenskin troops and the anvil of his base, while his space hulk drove off the forces of the Imperial Navy orbiting the world. Ghazghkull wanted to confront Yarrick himself, but when he found the elderly Commissar making a last stand at the wreck of his Baneblade (which had deliberately rammed one of the Gargants), Ghazghkull saw an opportunity to finally display his dominance over the other greenskins, and he ordered the human captured instead.
 Ghazghkull wanted to use Yarrick to assert his dominance over the other Orks, and to prove he understood how humans ""worked."" He first had Yarrick thrown down the garbage chute of his space hulk, proclaiming the human would escape. The other Orks were doubtful, since none of them had ever managed to survive the ordeal, but Yarrick would indeed resurface a few solar days later. Ghazghkull then had Yarrick thrown amongst the other Imperial prisoners, foretelling that the human would find a way to strike back and kill them all. True enough, Yarrick soon instigated a revolt and managed to reach the space hulk's bridge, where he sought to initiate its self-destruction by activating all the vessel's propulsion systems at once. He nearly succeeded at this endeavour before the Orks stopped him. This time, the other Orks were convinced that Ghazghkull could indeed predict the Human's behaviour, and Ghazghkull ordered Mad Doc Grotsnik to return the human's bionics. Ghazghkull then had Yarrick escorted by his Boyz to an intact shuttlecraft, where he allowed the human to leave the space hulk, telling him to prepare for the Orks' return to Armageddon. This nonchalant show of dominance firmly cemented Ghazghkull's place as Warlord of his massive WAAAGH!
 Thus began decades of long rebuilding. Carefully, Ghazghkull balanced marshalling the growing numbers of his army and the exponential WAAAGH! energy alongside the need to keep a low profile for the time being. Gork and Mork had advised him that he did not want to draw outside attention upon himself just yet. Never before had a WAAAGH!-leader tried to limit the numbers of Orks he attracted, but it was all part of the plan. Before he could take that next step towards ultimate victory, Ghazghkull would need more than just an enormous army: he would need to have his new tactics perfected and his new weapons working properly. He knew that if his influence expanded too quickly, the plan would not yet have grown ripe. Still, Ghazghkull launched raids across the Ultima Segmentum and beyond. Some were small, consisting of a few mobs; others were massed assaults capable of overrunning a planet. The attacks hit Imperial outposts or wreaked havoc amongst shipping lanes; the Orks also ventured into Tau space to smash colonies, or attacked other Ork territories. Ghazghkull led some expeditions, while for others he put a new corps of sub-commanders to the test. Beyond the value of plunder or even winning the engagements, the raids were done to train new leaders and test his latest strategies.
 If the Imperium had collected and analysed their scattered data files, they would have been alarmed by how many recorded attacks Ghazghkull, or armies bearing his insignia, had made. From 945 to 996.M41 there was an escalating pattern of violence, with many thousands of raids. But the Imperium was sprawling, bureaucratic, and beset by more obvious threats. Only the aged Yarrick, who had never ceased in his pursuit of his nemesis, still warned about any impending WAAAGH! directed by Ghazghkull. In the year 997.M41 Ghazghkull allied with the most infamous Bad Moon Warlord in many millennia --  Nazdreg Ug Urdgrub. The two leaders field-tested innovative ""Tellyporta"" technology -- the ability to send mobs of Boyz, vehicles, and ultimately, even the mountainous Gargants from a far distant space hulk down onto a planet. This was tested on the Imperial planet of Piscina IV. Only the Dark Angels saved that world from being overrun, but victory there was not Ghazghkull's real goal. His preparations were now over -- he was ready to unleash his full force upon the Imperium, exercising a plan fifty standard years in the making.
 During the fifty seven standard years following the Second War for Armageddon, Ghazghkull regrouped his forces, and reassessed his strategy. Remembering his defeat at Hades Hive on Armageddon over five decades earlier, he was not eager to repeat his mistake. He intended that Hades Hive would be one of the first places to fall. In light of its importance to the Imperium, Armageddon's defences were overhauled after Ghazghkull's first invasion nearly overwhelmed the planet. The star systems surrounding Armageddon were now heavily fortified. New naval stations and orbital defence platforms gave Armageddon a level of protection bettered only by Terra and a few others in the whole of the Imperium. Against the WAAAGH! that Ghazghkull unleashed, this didn't matter. With a grinding inevitability, Ghazghkull's junk-laden armada ploughed into realspace and advanced. In their wake, they left devastated planets as they steered towards Armageddon. Imperial task forces that sallied out to intervene were swallowed whole, never to return. In rightful panic, the distress call went out -- asking for reinforcements before the Orks could reach Armageddon.
 On the day of the Feast of the Emperor's Ascension, fifty-seven Terran years to the day after his first invasion, Ghazghkull returned. The orbital battle over Armageddon raged for two fiery nights, but by dawn of the third solar day the skies were filled with the vapour trails and the incandescent afterblaze of Ork dropships. In a roaring wave behind them came swarms of atmospheric fighter craft and swooping bomber jets. Ghazghkull chose not to fight at Hades Hive, that indomitable high water mark where his last invasion broke itself. This time, there would be no such defiance. In an act of terrible vengeance, giant asteroids aimed by orbiting space hulks smashed the entire hive apart, annihilating its inhabitants and its defenders. This was but a prelude to the bloodshed that would follow.
 Ground-based Defence Lasers and missile platforms reaped a horrific toll upon the Orks, filling the sulphur yellow skies with criss-crossing energy beams and blossoming explosions. Yet the greenskins were coming down in such numbers that, already, vast armies were building in the ash wastes. Feral Orks and Kommando teams burst from the equatorial jungles and mountain ranges of Armageddon to join the growing throngs. Quick-hitting strikes by the troops on the ground wrested control of many Macrocannons and Defence Lasers -- weapons that were soon turned upon their former owners. Other Orks worked to construct landing strips, allowing Dakkajets and Blitza-Bommerz to refuel and re-enter the fight more quickly. Gradually, the Orks began to dominate the dogfights that had been taking
place overhead, and they soon ruled the skies. Anywhere that the Imperial forces gathered to establish a defensive line was subjected to punishing bombardment and strafing runs.
 Through surging spearheads and the unbridled fury of their attacks, the Orks were gaining the upper hand everywhere. However, at that stage in the battle many Chapters of Space Marines began to arrive. Once again, their rapid assaults threatened to unravel the greenskin advance. Ghazghkull had foreseen this and prepared his own countermeasures. It was betrayal, not battle, that felled the first hive city, as Acheron was captured by treachery from within. To aid the wars raging across the ash wastes, Ghazghkull signalled for his next surprise. In orbit high above Armageddon, space hulks and asteroid fortresses jettisoned chunks of themselves to plummet downwards to Armageddon: the Ork Roks were unleashed.
 During his first invasion, Ghazghkull found his attacks blunted by rapid strikes from Space Marines. Despite the high mobility of the greenskin armies, they could not match the Adeptus Astartes' quick-hitting capabilities. Worse still, the stymied greenskin advances turned to routs before Ghazghkull could counterattack. The Roks changed all that. Ork Roks are hollowed-out hunks of asteroid that have been fitted with crude engines and weapons, and filled with troops. They descend from orbit and their fiery trail is slowed somewhat by powerful force fields, retro-rockets and modified Traktor Kannons.
 On Armageddon, the Roks made landings in the verdant equatorial jungles and across all of Armageddon’s continents, not just upon the populated landmasses of Primus and Secundus. Some Roks were lost to ground fire or smashed apart by their own impact, but many more survived. Not only did they slam into the planet to crush anything below, but the shockwaves of those landings were devastating. Even as the Space Marines began their attack runs to stall the Orks' advance, they found the Roks crashing amongst them. Each landed Rok became a bastion for the Orks, a rallying point and a ready-made fortress. But there was more: as well as guns, the Roks contained Tellyporta arrays like those first used by Ghazghkull in his Piscina campaign. These were swiftly used to bring Ork reinforcements to the planet, countering the Space Marines' attacks. They included special Marine-killa mobs, Stompas, artillery and even Gargants.
 Despite more and more Space Marine counterattacks striking deep into the Ork battlefronts, the Roks and the teleported reinforcements had the Imperium once again back on its heels. Ghazghkull still did not relent -– rather, he pressed his advantage. This was the perfect opportunity to unveil another tactic from his long-prepared arsenal of devastation: it was time to cut loose the Speed Freeks. Ork Kults of Speed have been around as long as there have been Orks. These velocity-addicted warriors are extremely mobile -- every trooper mounted on some type of Warbike, Warbuggy, or Trukk. While every klan has its speed-crazed Orks, this tendency is most common amongst the Evil Sunz. By their very nature, all Speed Freeks are fast, impulsive and likely to charge at the first opportunity. Only the commanding presence of Ghazghkull -- a no-nonsense Goff -- had any chance of using such headstrong forces in as controlled a fashion as he did. By Ghazghkull's orders, the Speed Freeks were held in reserve. It nearly killed them not to be first in battle, but instead to sit, doing nothing but revving their engines and waiting. Patience is not a virtue found amongst Speed Freeks. Yet Ghazghkull had been quite adamant in making his case -- making it, in fact, with his adamantium-plated head, by turning the wayward Evil Sunz Warlord, Gurbhag, and his kustom bike into a bloody scrapheap of broken parts. It had been a convincing argument. Only when the special Tellyporta-mobs had been sent to punch holes through the enemy lines were the Speed Freeks set loose.
 Able to exploit the tiniest gaps between battle lines, the Speed Freeks raced off in long columns. Where they needed to widen the path, the Warbikers blazed away with their weaponry -- unloading a storm of shot that scythed down Imperial Guardsmen in wide arcs of red ruin. Speed Freeks are known to sacrifice armour for speed, but, in true Ork fashion, their bikes and light vehicles never skimp on firepower, bearing more weaponry than any sane creature would expect upon such light frames. Across Armageddon Prime and Secundus, roving bands of Speed Freeks tore over the open plains of ash desert. With names like the Red Wheelz, Burning Death, and the Slasherz, each warhorde of Speed Freeks was made up of dozens of smaller warbands. The clouds of dust they kicked up as they accelerated across the barrens rivalled the toxic outflow of the Gargant Big Mobs, which spewed exhaust fumes that could be seen from outer space.
 Focussed on the myriad battles spread across the sprawling continents, few of the Imperial officers had time, or tactical acumen enough, to contemplate the big picture. Most would have denied that the Orks even had a plan -- pointing to the scores of assaults scattered across the vast planet, they saw the Orks' attack more as an anarchic mess than as a planned battlefront. They were mistaken. Ghazghkull orchestrated the fighting on Armageddon, and it was his tactical genius that designed the deadly combination that was winning the war. The scattered Rok landing sites had created strongpoints from which Ork armies gathered, and they also served as homers on which the Tellyportas could lock and beam down a steady flow of reinforcements. It was necessary for the Imperium to concentrate their attacks upon these sites, leaving them vulnerable to the lightning assaults of the Speed Freeks.
 Even as the forces of the Imperium moved to eliminate the threat of the Roks, they found themselves being hunted. Fast and hard-hitting Speed Freek columns wreaked havoc upon the Imperial forces in the open plains, weaving in and out of different formations and launching daring hit and run attacks. Zagboss Skargrim, notorious leader of the Burning Death Speed Freeks, encircled and destroyed entire regiments of Imperial Guardsmen. The Burning Death were well known for their love of fire, and the trapped humans were herded into large groups, setting up massed Skorcha runs that lit up the night skies. Streaking above the ash wastes, air wings of Dakkajet and Burna-bommer skwadrons acted as mobile artillery for the Speed Freeks. A fierce competition between the air and ground forces began, with each side striving to kill their target before the other could join the battle. Many friendly fire incidents were not accidental, but the deliberate results of overly frustrated rivals who arrived on the scene to discover their foes already destroyed.
 The Imperium's focus and counterattacks were wholly fixated upon the Ork Roks and the Speed Freeks warbands that wove maddeningly out of their reach. At this stage in the battle, Ghazghkull deemed the time was ripe to attack the hive cities. The Warboss personally led the many hordes on their route to attack Hive Infernus. Even as the few Imperial reserves were committed, word came from the seaport hives of yet more massive Ork attacks there. Mysteriously, Ork Roks had made landings in the Fire Wastes and Dead Lands to the north and south of the main continent of Armageddon. These grim lands had been believed to be uninhabitable, but their value became apparent solar weeks later when hundreds of tanker-sized Ork submersibles rose from the polluted waters and made landings at Hives Tempestora and Helsreach. Surprise was total, and within solar days Tempestora fell, although hive gang militia held out long enough at Helsreach for Tempestus Scions and Space Marines to arrive, preventing the Orks from overrunning the other half of the hive. Besieged and bombarded, Tartarus Hive drove off their greenskin attackers, but the victory was a hollow one. The hive was ruined, its great factories torn apart for scrap by industrious Deathskull Scrapmobs.
 Just south of the Plains of Anthrand, a vital water processing plant known as Ghattana Bay was the site of a battle that escalated to become the largest Dreadnought conflict of the campaign. Large vehicles could not navigate the maze of pipes that made up the vast refinery, and without armour to oppose them, the Dread Mobs were an unstoppable force, able to gun down or smash aside all the human infantry that dared defend those twisted corridors. The Orks were only checked by the arrival of Space Marine Dreadnoughts from no fewer than five different Chapters. Tankbustas and Space Marine Devastators moved into the tangle of pipelines, hoping to shift the balance upon that deadly battlefield. Although the Orks were ultimately forced to withdraw, the damage wrought upon the facility by the greenskins was irreparable, cutting off water to much of Armageddon Prime.
 The size of the escalating war on Armageddon was becoming difficult to imagine. Billions of lives had been lost in the unending battle, so that the very world had become a byword for war and destruction on a massive scale. It was a place where the mightiest war machines in the galaxy clashed and heroes died in droves. Orks from across the galaxy felt the vibrations of the WAAAGH!. Like moths to a flame, the most aggressive greenskins were being drawn toward Armageddon, seeking fame and glory. But the Third War for Armageddon had spread beyond the planet, for the whole sub-sector was rife with Ork raiders. Those worlds left vulnerable by the Imperial commitment to the Armageddon War were now burned themselves. Rumours abounded that Ghazghkull had called the Ragnarork, the Great WAAAGH!, the final apocalyptic battle in which the Orks would prove their worth before the eyes of their violent and primitive gods.
 To counter the Orks, the Imperium had been forced into a total war footing, feeding the meatgrinder with entire planetary populations' worth of troops. A thousand light year recruitment zone was established around Armageddon. Every Imperial world within that area had their tithe of Imperial Guard regiments tripled and their industry turned over solely to armaments production. Even the Imperial logisticians, themselves numbering more than a large army, could only estimate how many Imperial Guard had taken part in the defence of Armageddon, to say nothing of tracking the wealth of other forces. At the last tally, this included elements of at least twenty-five different Chapters of Adeptus Astartes, several Orders of Adepta Sororitas, and six Titan Legions. Within the Armageddon Sector was the better part of seventeen Imperial Navy fleets. Worst still, those figures were outdated by at least a Terran year, a time period in which the war had only grown larger.
 The Imperium had always dreaded the unification of so many Ork tribes, and now its worst fears were coming true. Already the wisest of the Imperial leaders faced the grim realisation that it was likely that the industry of Armageddon would soon be ruined beyond repair. The war was now less about saving Armageddon and more about preserving its sub-sector and, most sobering of all, preventing the ever-swelling tide of Orks from growing larger. If the great green menace could not be contained upon Armageddon, then it would sweep outwards and threaten the heart of the Imperium itself -– Holy Terra. Although it pained him to leave the largest battle he had ever seen, Ghazghkull knew he had work to do elsewhere.
 Only the pull of destiny could drag the most dangerous Ork Warlord away from the battle that raged across Armageddon. But with the great green visions starting to overwhelm him, Ghazghkull knew it was time to move on. That battle was now self-perpetuating, and he was needed to spread the ripples of WAAAGH! energy until they washed the galaxy in blood. Even as he waded through shellbursts and claimed Space Marine helmets for his trophy rack, Ghazghkull could feel the pressure building behind his adamantium plate. He was about to have another vision and, if the pain in his skull was any indication, it was going to be a monumental one. It was too much to fight. Ghazghkull returned to his orbiting ship, Kill Wrecka, and at last gave in to the green flashes that were filling his patchwork mind.
 The voices of Gork and Mork had never been so strident, their bellowing still echoing in Ghazghkull's head. Yet, no matter how many times he readjusted his thinking parts by beating them against the bulwark of the ship, Ghazghkull could not clear his head, nor decipher what the guttural voices of the gods were saying to him. The pain of the visions was excruciating, and his good eye bulged as he roared in agony. Any other Ork would consider a good scrap like Armageddon a victory in itself, but they lacked ambition. Ghazghkull, blessed with his conqueror's visions, did not know exactly what he was looking for, and grasped only that he would not find it on Armageddon. Trusting that the voices would become clear in time, he ordered a handful of voidcraft from the fleet that still surrounded Armageddon like vultures to gather around Kill Wrecka. Ghazghkull left the battle for Armageddon knowing his appointed lieutenants would command in his stead as he had ordered. The greatest Ork Warlord of his era looked back upon the rapidly shrinking orb of Armageddon, and his only regret was that he doubted he would be back before his underlings conquered everything in his name.
 As the fleet gathered speed, Ghazghkull turned from the portal and looked about the bridge. On his orders, a herd of Weirdboy Warpheads had been gathered. It was his hope that the deranged Ork mystics could aid his visions in a way similar to how their strange gifts seemed to help steer the best course once a space hulk entered the Warp. Thus far, however, all the Weirdboyz had done was annoy Ghazghkull. The hulking Warlord watched the drooling Warpheads totter about the bridge, bumping into each other like Boyz in a fungus beer stupor. In truth, such antics angered Ghazghkull -- the old Goff in him resolved troubles or ambiguities with a simple punch to the face. Unbeknownst to Ghazghkull, however, his departure from Armageddon did not go unmarked.
 Imperial augur-stations observed the Ork flotilla leaving the system, identifying the vessel known as Kill Wrecka, the capital ship favoured by Ghazghkull. The Armageddon High Command was notified, and within solar days the pursuit was underway. Commissar Yarrick headed one fleet and High Marshal Helbrecht of the Black Templars led the other. They had allowed Ghazghkull to escape once and it cost them dearly; a mistake, Yarrick vowed, that would not be repeated. Using a pincer approach, the faster, more efficient Imperial warships converged upon the Ork fleet several solar weeks after leaving Armageddon. Outnumbered in the midst of a barren space known as the Haunted Gulf, Ghazghkull realised he could not outrun his foes. With nowhere to hide, he ordered the fleet to steer directly into the midst of their enemies. By the weight of their broadsides the Ork flotilla might yet be able to blast a path to freedom.
 Despite Yarrick's warning that such a desperate manoeuvre was not just possible, but likely, the forces of the Imperium were still surprised by the unorthodox gambit. Several Battle Cruisers were left crippled by the Ork ploy, little more than drifting hulks. However, the return fire ripped the scrapfleet apart, destroying Ork voidships one after another. Kill Wrecka was left listing badly, its steering wrecked. As Yarrick and Helbrecht prepared to board the Ork vessel in order to personally ensure Ghazghkull's demise, Kill Wrecka was wreathed in a blaze of green energy.
 Kill Wrecka rocked back and forth from the Lance strikes that penetrated its lower decks. The resulting explosions blasted concussive forces through the ship, making the entire voidcraft lurch violently and sending everyone on the command deck sprawling. Ghazghkull toppled over hard, his adamantium-clad skull denting the steel deckplates with a clang. Furious, he pushed out of the pile of Weirdboyz that had shifted on top of him and bellowed orders. It was then, his head still ringing from the impact, that an overwhelming force possessed Ghazghkull. An arcing crown of green lightning exploded outward, washing everyone in a strange, green light.
 The sudden explosion of energies was a spark that set off the Warpheads, each convulsing in rhythmic spasms that grew in intensity. Engulfed in green flames, the crazed Ork psykers howled as their skin sizzled and raw power burst forth from their eyes and gushed forth from their jaws. In voices like rolling thunder, the Warpheads spoke as one, the same almighty roar of Gork and Mork that Ghazghkull had been hearing. Now, at last, he understood what he needed to do. The voice of the gods commanded Ghazghkull to unite the Orks and make the galaxy echo to the sound of the Great WAAAGH!.
 The powerful voice spoke again, saying that only unending battle would call the final Ragnarork, bringing forth Gork and Mork themselves. With their role in delivering the message done, the Warpheadz exploded in a vast oupouring of energy, drenching all those on the command deck with wet viscera and luminescent green energy. It was this surge of green power that rolled outwards, striking the enemy fleet like a tidal wave. With their ships' systems ensnared by strange energies, Yarrick and Helbrecht could only watch in frustration as Kill Wrecka blinked once and was gone. The only evidence that it had ever been there was a trail of debris floating where the ship had once been. Yarrick slumped, for he knew that Ghazghkull's escape boded ill for the galaxy.
 Kill Wrecka was hurled into the Warp, its course and destination unknown. Every greenskin on board endured an unsettling journey in which the echoes of that mighty voice still boomed in their minds. How long they travelled, or where they spun towards, none could say. Then, with a feeling similar to a punch in the gut, they halted, reappearing suddenly in realspace. The Orks staggered to the portholes, looking out and gasping in amazement. They were completely surrounded by voidships of all sizes, but there could be no mistaking the make of such crude, rust-bucket-like craft. Kill Wrecka had materialised precisely in the middle of an Ork fleet.
 Only recently, Kill Wrecka had been an imposing vessel, its hulls protected by overlapping slabs of iron plate and bristling with turrets, gun decks and all manner of ordnance. However, after the Imperial fleet had punched a number of holes through the voidcraft's belly, internal explosions had done the rest. Ghazghkull's Meks began to swarm over the ship, repairing breaches to the inner hull and patching up the pipes which vented gases into the corridors. The Orks under Warlord Urgok Da Slayer -– for that was whose fleet they had appeared amidst –- doubtless took Kill Wrecka for space junk, thinking that some scrap-mongering Deathskulls or salvage-crazed Meks were simply cutting up pieces of old wreckage.
 On board, Ghazghkull cared less about the hull repairs, instead ordering his Meks to fix the damaged Tellyporta. While they hustled about their tasks, the Prophet of Gork and Mork prepared his boarding parties. It was easy to pick out where the biggest Ork would be, for just above them in the centre of the fleet was a monstrous space hulk. So much work had gone into that vessel that it now looked like an Ork fortress floating in space. Knowing his advantage was surprise, Ghazghkull trusted to luck and teleported blind. As if guided by the great green hands of Gork and Mork themselves, Ghazghkull and a mob of his baddest Nobz -– his Bullyboyz –- appeared in a green flash in Warlord Urgok's command room. The action that followed was swift and bloody, the deck soon covered with the mangled corpses of the slain. Before they could recover from their shock, most of Urgok's bodyguard were slain and Ghazghkull had pulled Urgok off his throne and beaten him senseless. So started a new WAAAGH!.
 Urgok's fleet was substantial in size before Ghazghkull arrived, but it grew exponentially when the Prophet of Gork and Mork took over. Like all Ork-made creations, it was an anarchic jumble. Most of the voidships were wholly built out of cast-off flotsam scavenged from the ends of the galaxy; others had once been the vessels of some other race, but had been salvaged and ""upgraded"" by the Orks. They came from all corners of the galaxy, some even from distant eras, having been found drifting in the Warp. Even ships of the same type in the same squadron were rarely comparable, for each had gone through many impromptu builds and refits, each using whatever scrap could be found. It was not the greenskin way to repair things either, so much as patch over them. And no Mek was ever fully satisfied, but thought he could add another gun deck, missile silo, torpedo tube or other shooty wotnotz here or there.
 Within that ramshackle armada was a pair of heavy-prowed Hammer Battlekroozers that had stood keel to keel with Imperial Battleships and come out the victors. Some half dozen Kill Kroozers and Terror Ships rounded out the larger voidcraft. Before them came a tide of lesser vessels, some little more than rustbuckets with thruster engines, yet they were deadly despite their worn and decrepit appearance. The pride of the fleet was Urgok's space hulk -- a colossus of a starcraft, with firepower to almost equal that of an entire Imperial battlefleet.
 Warlord Urgok's empire had grown so large that it took solar weeks for Ghazghkull to work his way through it. Most joined the Prophet of Gork and Mork willingly, but some stubborn cases needed to be shown a few messy examples before they too saw the wisdom of aligning themselves under Ghazghkull. When he regained consciousness, Urgok Da Slayer himself became a leader within Ghazghkull's throng, and this made recruiting the rest of his armies easier. If the galaxy was going to be set ablaze with WAAAGH! energy, many more Orks were needed.
 Orks are a prolific race and can be found throughout the entire galaxy. It would be the work of a million lifetimes to seek out every greenskin-held territory, to travel to the innumerable places where greenskins gathered in dominating numbers -- countless moons, planets, asteroid fields, or space hulks drifting in the void between the stars. As Ghazghkull knew, such travel was not needed, for all Orks were called by the power of the WAAAGH!. Urgok's
wars had been drawing in a steady stream of greenskins, new recruits rising to the call of fighting, space travel and the promise of greater battles. Under Ghazghkull, this rivulet became a cascading downpour as floods of greenskins rushed to join the fleet. Now they needed purpose.
 With agitated Ork hordes raring for battle, Ghazghkull steered the fleet towards Ork territory. The remnants of his WAAAGH!-tuned brain had felt the distant ripples of green energies that came from distant Octarius. Rumours had come of a new leader of that realm, and it was Ghazghkull's intent to wrest the title ""Overfiend of Octarius"" for himself. However, what he found when he got there was even better.
 Octarius had been Ork territory for many thousands of standard years. It was not as backwater a subsector as where Urk had been, and every so often a leader would rise up, call a WAAAGH!, and lead an invasion off to wreck some part of the galaxy. Indeed, the old Warlord Gorsnik Magash had rushed off to join Ghazghkull in the Golgotha Sector and was currently heading a vast force of Orks on Armageddon, holding his own in the Dead Lands. Since Gorsnik's departure, a new leader had quickly risen to fill the power vacuum and claim the title Overfiend of Octarius -- a Deathskull Warlord named Zog Steeltoof.
 Despite his copious use of blue warpaint, the rule of Zog Steeltoof had thus far not been a lucky one. Tyranids had returned, sweeping into the biomass-rich Ork territory, consuming entire planets as they advanced. The fight, known as the Octarian War, raged across the whole sector, its epicentre squarely targeted upon Octaria, the central world of the greenskin territory. The entire mega-continent of Octaria was a battlefield into which both sides poured their might. The Overfiend's Orks, grown big and strong on their diet of constant war, had met their match. The ever-evolving spawn of Hive Fleet Leviathan were gaining the upper hand, showering the planet with reinforcements, sending yet further broods of killing beasts into the non-stop melee. Across Octaria the Orks were forced to take refuge in scrap-iron fortifications. It seemed only a matter of time before the Tyranids collapsed each of the jury-rigged fortresses. Then WAAAGH! Ghazghkull descended from the spore-ridden skies.
 At first, the Overfiend's Orks thought the Roks blazing through the atmosphere were some kind of new foe. All across Octaria they landed, smashing gaping holes through the Gargoyle-filled skies and ploughing into the scuttling hordes on the ground. It was not slime-covered, chitin-plated Tyranid creatures that emerged from the asteroids, however, but more Orks. They surged outwards, taking the fight to the Tyranids while the Roks themselves opened up with heavy calibre ordnance. The greenskins behind their shabby defences let loose volleys of cheers and a hail of supporting fire of their own. Then came the heavy, ground-shaking footfalls of incoming creatures of immense size. The Hive Mind had noted the arrival of these invaders.
 The Tyranid response was frighteningly quick. Larger swarm creatures-- hulking scythe-limbed horrors and Gargant-sized beasts -- lumbered to oppose this new greenskin threat from the skies. The raucous chants of Octaria's Orks died in their throats, for they knew that these towering behemoths had been held in reserve, saved for the final death strike. When the Orks' defences had been breached, these monsters would have arrived. Now the newcomers would be shredded, for there could be no hope for infantry out in the open. 
 To their surprise, the air flashed as Tellyportas began to bring more reinforcements. All across Octaria, the cratered Rok landing sites now blazed with unnatural lights. After each flash, more and more mobs appeared, and these were not just infantry. Arriving with guns chugging, Gorkanauts and Stompas concentrated their firepower on the larger foes, while at their feet Burna Boyz mobs spread out. With each blast from their weapons they sent blossoms of red fire leaping out to flash-fry the lesser creatures in droves. Amidst the mobs pouring forth, countless crude banners and totems could be seen, carried high by the newly arriving troops or mounted atop clanking Battlewagons. The Orks of Octaria saw the symbols and knew who had arrived...
 At Gargates, the Overfiend's shanty capital, Ghazghkull Thraka himself appeared via Tellyporta. He led the charge at the head of his Bullyboyz as they crashed through the serpentine Raveners that were beginning to undermine the first lines of defence. To the Greenskins that watched, this massive Warlord in Mega Armour fought like Gork himself. He wove in and out of sight in the swirling carnage, but he was easy to pick out. An aura of green brutality seemed to surround him and he clobbered each of his foes so hard that limbs, heads and claws flew in bloody arcs all around him. He moved like some elemental destructive force, a one-Ork wave of destruction. His Kustom Shoota spat death and with every swipe, Ghazghkull's Power Klaw sliced multiple foes in half. Every motion, from his elbow backswing to the stomp of his iron-shod feet, cracked the shell-like armour of the Tyranids and sent more to fall, thrashing their death throes on the blood-strewn ground.
 And then the unbelievable happened.
 The body-strewn landscape at Ghazghkull's feet seemed to buckle and bulge upwards. Then Ghazghkull was gone. A Mawloc had come. It burst from below and, as its bulk breached the surface, the creature coiled about itself like some hideous constricting serpent. This was the largest such creature any of the assembled Orks had seen -- the deadliest spawn of its kind that ever slithered underground or was seen by the light of any sun. The triumphal screech that burst from the beast's gaping maw twisted metal and made Orks miles away fall and cover their ears. Even before its screech of victory was over, however, something had gone wrong. The Mawloc heaved -- flopping its mass so that it seemed the world itself trembled. Then the beast quivered, writhing in convulsions, twisting its mighty coils in arcing loops. An unnatural bulge formed in its midsection and out thrust a Power Klaw, amidst geysers of gore and slime-covered entrails. Shoota blasts widened the hole and out stepped Ghazghkull, striding out of the very belly of the beast. The mightiest of Ork Warlords roared his victory to the skies, a rallying cry to greenskins and a challenge to all else that lived.
 After that, nothing could stop the Orks. Chanting their Warlord's name, the greenskins of WAAAGH! Ghazghkull went on a kill-rampage, hacking, shooting and slaying in a berserk frenzy. From behind scrap-iron walls, the Orks of Octaria burst forth to join in. Even Zog Steeltoof, the Overfiend of Octarius, was chanting the name Ghazghkull as he gunned down the living wall of Tyranids that attempted to stay the greenskin onslaught. A great butchery began, and it did not stop until Octaria was free of the creatures of the Leviathan.
 Though Ghazghkull had little time to prepare, he made the most of it. Meks welded iron-plated walls back into position, or patched acid-eaten holes. Others sighted new kannons and anti-aircraft weapons, better integrating the Roks into the overall defence. 
 Under the keen eyes of the great Big Mek Orkimedes, a few snazzy upgrades, from Tellyporta pads to Pulsa Rokkits, would give the intergalactic aliens something new to chew on. If anything, this fight looked to be even bigger than the one on Armageddon. 
 Even as the skies began to darken as a huge, brooding shadow covered the stars above, Ghazghkull looked up and bared his fang-like teef in as close to a grin as he could manage. His WAAAGH! was only getting started...
 Since leaving Armageddon, the visions that temporarily filled Ghazghkull's surgically repaired brain had become more frequent. Some of these were strong convulsions that toppled the big Ork over, causing him to writhe in howling agony. Other visions were less obtrusive, and these Ghazghkull was slowly gaining control over. They showed him brief snippets of the action back on Armageddon; Ghazghkull saw Zagboss Skargrim tearing it up on his Warbike, or watched Kommandant Klank lead his Boyz to another victory.
 Even in the dream-like visions, the sight of Orks marching in rows like Human troops was infuriating, but he could not argue with the Blood Axe Warlord's battle record. Ghazghkull knew that these weren't dreams; he knew he was watching real events unfold. Despite the vast distance, sometimes, when he issued commands or tactical advice during particularly gripping visions, Ghazghkull swore his voice carried and his subordinates heard his every bellow. 
 This thought amused him; he heeded the voices in his head, and his lieutenants were likewise tormented. As for Ghazghkull's own voices -- they were already warning him that once the battle on Octaria got going, it would be time to leave. He had a destiny to meet. He only needed three or four more sectors raging with battle to swell the Ork population to critical mass. 
 In his vision, Ghazghkull was stomping across the galaxy. His strides spanned stars beyond count and each of his mighty footprints were swathes of planets aflame with war -- Armageddon, Octaria...he was already anxious for the start of the next great conflict.
 After the opening of the Great Rift, Ghazgkhull left the Octarius warzone, and led a fleet of over 5 million Greenskin warships against the forces of the Imperium. He eventually fell into conflict with the Space Wolves Chapter on the world of Krongar. 
 During the Battle of Krongar, Ghazgkhull's head was severed by the Wolf Lord Ragnar Blackmane. Ghazghkull had deliberately separated himself and the Wolf Lord from the other combatants by detonating explosives which blocked the entrance to the Imperial cathedral where they met with debris. 
 The subsequent duel was bitterly contested but the Wolf Lord slowed Ghazghkull by slicing through the hydraulic cabling for his Mega Armour. Though slowed, Ghazghkull was not defeated, and he eventually caught up Blackmane and began to crush him in his Power Klaw. 
 Yet, even while he was being crushed to death, Blackmane summoned the strength to decapitate Ghazghkull with his Frost Blade. Blackmane lifted Ghazghkull's head up high and howled in victory. 
 In the wake of his decapitation, Ghazghkull found his spirit trapped between life and death. In this disembodied state he lamented only that nobody would bring back Makari after his inevitable next death and that his work, the furtherance of the Great WAAAGH!, would remain forever incomplete.
 Ghazgkhull was resurrected shortly afterwards by the medical skills of Mad Dok Grotsnik when a Grot stumbled upon the fallen warlord's severed head and the Mad Dok performed emergency surgery to reattach it to a new, even bigger Greenskin body. 
 This new body was created by Grotsnik from the few remaining portions of Ghazgkhull's original body, as well as various body parts taken from other Orks, some willingly, including one Greenskin who ripped out his own heart ""to give to the boss."" Unfortunately, the organ was destroyed in the course of the operations to rebuild Ghazghkull's body. 
 In the place of an organic heart, Grotsnik instead modified the fuel pump of a Trukk and used that as the warlord's new heart.
 Grotsnik next made use of a power generator placed into orbit of Krongar that existed in both realspace and the Immaterium simultaneously to unleash a beam of green lightning at the place on the surface where Ghazghkull's form lay. The resurrection attempt had an 80% chance of unleashing a blast that might incinerate half of the world, but the viridian beam actually succeeded in bringing Ghazghkull back to life after 10 solar days and nights in which he was technically dead. 
 The warlord had also been brought back in a body that was larger than before and made him even more powerful. Such was now his strength in the WAAAGH! that just his physical presence could serve as a psychic beacon to draw other Greenskins from light years away.
 According to Ghazghkull, the Prophet of Gork and Mork, the Great WAAAGH! has finally begun. 
 Greenskin legends have always spoken of the ""Ragnarork,"" the time when the Orks finally rise up to conquer the galaxy in a series of apocalyptic battles. 
 Orks everywhere across the galaxy are gripped by mass agitation, and their migration towards key battles has begun...
 When the galaxy-spanning Imperium of Mankind first encountered Ghazghkull, its leaders presumed he was like all the other Ork Warlords before him. Perhaps he was larger and stronger than most, but no more than that. After several battles, they begrudgingly granted that Ghazghkull possessed more beast-like cunning than was exhibited by the other leaders of his savage species, but they still gave him little credence. 
 A very few of his human antagonists started to grasp the magnitude of Ghazghkull's ambition, but only by the time of the Third War for Armageddon did they realise that this was an Ork Warlord beyond any they had previously encountered. Those opponents who have underestimated Ghazghkull only do so once, for they rarely survive contact with the Warlord. The few fortunate enough to escape speak of raw power and armies beyond count -- all guided by the same grand vision. 
 Unlike other Orks, Ghazghkull has shown a remarkable ability to learn from his failures -- with each fight, he grows stronger and more cunning. Over the years, he has refined his tactics, devising new strategies based on his observations in previous battles. 
 More ominous still for his foes, Ghazghkull has developed the ability to experiment -- to test out new concepts in order to better hone them. Whether the voices Ghazghkull hears in his head are truly those of Gork and Mork is unknown. What cannot be gainsaid, however, is that the canny Ork appears to have some prescient ability. Time and again, the Ork Warlord appears in exactly the right place, at the right time.
 Ghazghkull has proven to be a master strategist, the greatest of his kind. He outmanoeuvres his enemies, steamrolling over their assaults and sidestepping their carefully laid traps as if anticipating them in advance. In his lengthy campaigns, Ghazghkull has shown to be a masterful organiser whose prepared assaults rival the meticulous battle plans of the Astra Militarum. 
 However, there is nothing of the hidebound tactician in Ghazghkull, for he is an innovator and a cunning opportunist, ever ready to shift his troops to exploit any sudden weakness an opponent might present. And there are no fighters more brutal –- more joyous in the act of crushing their foes –- than the raucous, battle-loving warriors of WAAAGH! Ghazghkull.
 As some of the Imperium's foremost tactical minds have already learned, Ghazghkull is their strategic match –- or more. But the news grows worse for those that would oppose the oncoming green wave. Ghazghkull's hordes are growing in number and skill, and he is gathering under his sway not just mindless followers, eager to do his bidding, but also mighty Warlords who would not bow before any other Ork's dominion save for Ghazghkull's.
 Confident in his own matchless superiority, Ghazghkull has avoided a common pitfall amongst his green-skinned kind -- that of attempting to do everything himself. Other Warlords feel they must always lead from the front, spearheading all attacks, while keeping as watchful an eye on their own lieutenants as they do upon the enemy; after all, it is a personal disaster for a Warlord to be surpassed in deeds by any of his underlings. 
 By contrast, Ghazghkull's authority is so absolute that he need not display such caution. Instead, he cunningly deploys his forces to where their talents are best used, exemplifying his age-old maxim: ""Don't send a Speed Freek to do a Dread Mob's job."" 
 Due to Ghazghkull's strategic prowess, his ability to adapt, and the sheer force of his character, he now leads the largest force of greenskins seen in millennia. This Great WAAAGH! is poised not just to ravage a few planets or trample a star system or two; it is on a course to conquer the entire galaxy!
 Makari was an exceptionally lucky Grot who survived to the ripe old age of nine standard years before finally meeting his accidental end under the posterior of his hulking master. 
 The plucky Gretchin served as self-appointed banner-waver to the mighty Ghazghkull Thraka himself, surviving countless battles in ever more improbable ways. 
 Ghazghkull saw Makari as something of a mascot. Thus, when the Grot's remains were peeled off his boss' rear end, Makari's wavin' stikk was reclaimed, hosed down, and went into service as an impressive Bosspole. 
 Good fortune still surrounds Da Lucky Stikk, though the backlash when things go wrong can be surprisingly brutal.
 The story of Makari's death after being sat on by Ghazghkull may have been spread by Imperial propagandists seeking to humiliate the great Ork Warlord, as Makari in the Era Indomitus has still been witnessed following Ghazghull into battle. 
 However, it is also possible that Ghazghull may be ""volunteering"" new Grots for the honour of becoming his standard-bearer, and that each ""Makari"" has had a life as short as that of any other Grot among the Greenskins, dying in battle or from careless happenstance.
 One of the reasons that Makari has survived so long is because he is no ordinary Gretchin. He is stronger, tougher and more resilient than the rest of his kin.
 Unlike the Grot Blasters carried by his Gretchin brethren, Makari carries a Stabba, preferring to do his fighting up close and personal. It's a surprisingly effective weapon, and Makari has even managed to kill a Tempestus Scion with the little blade.
 WAAAGH! Ghazghkull had grown impossibly large, but during his first invasion of Armageddon, the greenskins primarily came from Urk and its surroundings. Ghazghkull has bound the varied tribes to his own vision of rampant destruction,
and while he can get the most out of any greenskin, there are certain mobs or warbands he prefers over all others.
 Despite what the growing Ork legends said, the true genius of Ghazghkull Thraka had nothing to do with his rock-splitting headbutt. What really set Ghazghkull apart was his leadership. It was his gift to get the best out of every Ork that made him so dangerous. Few Warlords can mesh the different klanz, playing each to its strengths, rather than leaving them to work towards their own narrow-minded proclivities. Though Ghazghkull liked a hardened fighting core of Goff warriors, he always picked the right tool for the task at hand. However, he did not do so alone, for Ghazghkull also had an eye for spotting Orks destined for greatness.
 Scattered about WAAAGH! Ghazghkull were a range of the most talented Orks to stalk the galaxy. This was not a formal council, but a loose ring of the most powerful and influential Warbosses from the tribes, along with the most over-achieving Oddboyz. Perhaps the most famous amongst this group was Orkimedes, the genius Mek behind such inventions as Tellyporta technology and attack 'ubmersibles. When he remained lucid, Mad Dok Grotsnik was also in this group, as was the Evil Sunz Warlord Zagboss Skargrim, the aged, but still mighty, Snakebite Grand Tusk Chieftain Molok, militant-minded Kommandant Klank of the Blood Axes, Nazdreg of the Bad Moons, and perhaps a dozen others. Even when Ghazghkull was not nearby, these dynamic lieutenants acted in his name, ensuring his plans were carried through. In essence, they became the right hands of WAAAGH! Ghazghkull.
 To any non-greenskin, Ork armies are barbaric and anarchic hordes -- a ragtag assembly with no rhyme or reason. Orks are extremely hierarchical, however, and though they may appear to be shambolic hordes, any WAAAGH! has a strict ordering and takes on the character of the Ork who leads it. 
 As his WAAAGH! has grown so large, Ghazghkull relies upon a hardened core of mobs and warbands. These forces are organised in the way the Great Prophet of Gork and Mork prefers; their leaders have learned to fight using their own aggressive initiative, but also tactics and cunning instilled by their mastermind leader. These are warriors, mobs and formations that draw the most difficult and brutal of tasks, spearheading key assaults or attacking vital positions.
 Though Orks rarely go to the trouble of distinguishing between forces of different sizes, the following are common Imperial designations used when estimating the size and relative threat of greenskin incursions:
 Orks of the Goff klan are identified by their preference for black and red wargear, and their symbol, the Horned Bull. Goffs are straightforward and grim; they eschew flashy colours, but do go for bold glyphs and check patterns. 
 Unlike other klanz, Goffs take good care of the tools of their trade -- their weapons. Being a Goff himself, Ghazghkull preferred to use battle-hardened mobs of Goffs whenever he could.
 Goff Infantry includes the following forces:
 DA GOREBOYZ
 BULZAK'S DESROYAZ
 GRAND WARLORD GHULG's WARHORDE
 Ghazghkull values mobility, so it is no suprise that at the heart of his WAAAGH! can be found many Blitz Brigades –- motorised columns of Trukks and Battlewagons, each carrying a bloodthirsty mob of Orks. While all the klanz are represented, Ghazghkull puts extra stock in those from his own klan, the Goff Blitzboyz. 
 Goff Blitzboyz may not be as fast as the more infamous Speed Freeks of the Evil Sunz, but they pack more of a punch when they hit. Goffs particularly favour Battlewagons with Deff Rollas or reinforced rams -- even more so if those rams are shaped like the classic Goff horn symbol. 
 Their infantry are loaded down with weapons; they have learned to carry extras, as the tuck and roll of rapid deployment and the sheer impetus of their assaults has been known to knock a few loose.
 GURAT's MOB
 BLACK DEFF BLITZ BRIGADE
 KRAGRAK'S BLITZDAKKA WARBAND
 KROKSNIK'S DEFF TRAKK TRIBE
 Like a traditional Goff, Ghazghkull places a greater value on brutal close-range violence than the Warlord of any other Ork klan. This being the case, it is no surprise that WAAAGH! Ghazghkull attracts the ""ardest of da 'ard.""
 A profusion of Killa Kanz, Deff Dreads and even larger walkers can be found fighting alongside or amidst the Goff infantry. These metal monstrosities clank along amidst the Boyz mobs, greatly augmenting their striking power. 
 Ghazghkull has learned through experience (if not the whispered leadings of the gods themselves) to mob his Killa Kans and Deff Dreads together into armoured wedges –- smoke-spewing, lurching units that can stomp down enemy hordes or hack through enemy elites. 
 Although Ghazghkull will find a place in his plans for any of these so-called ""Dread Mobs"", he favours those of his own klan.
 While it is true that Goffs despise lowly Gretchin, most have learned a grudging respect for those that manage to pilot a Killa Kan. In these hulking metal husks, the Gretchin are not scrawny weaklings, but death-dealing bruisers capable of the Ork ideal: blasting, stomping and mauling foes into an indistinguishable pulpy mass. 
 For this reason, Killa Kanz are readily accepted into Goff warbands as well as the formidable Dread Mobs. Of course, it is possible that many Goff Boyz simply don't know that there is a grot inside such an excellent killing machine.
 KRUD'S KANS DREAD MOB
 BLACKHORNZ DREAD MOB
 STOMPY DEFF DREAD MOB
 Ugrak's Uglies are part of a battle-hardened and fighty core of Goffs that form the centre of WAAAGH! Ghazghkull. Ugrak was a Goff champion who led a Nobz mob on Urk. 
 After a thunderous headbutt from Ghazghkull, he saw the light (many lights, actually) and, when he recovered, Ugrak pledged his red Power Klaw to the hardest hitting Warlord he had ever met. 
 It was aboard Wurld Killa, after one of the many battles against daemonic attacks, that Ugrak kitted himself and his Nobz mob with Mega Armour. Having risen in prominence since then, Ugrak now leads an entire Goff warband -- da Uglies. 
 They are relentless footslogging infantry, with Boyz and Nobz in 'eavy armour -- often much scratched and worn by the rigours of close combat. 
 At various times, Ugrak's Uglies have acted as Ghazghkull's personal bodyguard, and they had the honour of leading the spearhead attack that helped break down the final blast door of Hades Hive.
 Who knows what the Gorkanaut named ""da Mangler"" was called before the Battle of Black Krater during the latter stages of the Third Armageddon War? Whatever it was, that moniker has been long forgotten, replaced with a new title earned in blood and glory. 
 After the blocky metal death machine single-handedly halted a humie counter-attack, it drove into their midst. The awestruck Ork Boyz who followed in its wake were well impressed with the trail of destruction the war engine left behind. 
 They passed flipped-over armoured personnel carriers, their hulls ripped open and the humies inside crushed flat. A swathe of foes lay ripped apart -- evidence of the aptly named deffstorm mega-shoota. Closer to hand, entire squads of enemy soldiers lay in ruin, from which the gory trackmarks of the Gorkanaut rolled on.
 At last catching up to the hard-driving war engine, the Orks witnessed such a display of violence unleashed that day that they stood agog. The Gorkanaut broke through the defensive line, scattering the humie guns and equipment and thrusting its klaw of Gork straight into an Imperial bunker. 
 The screams of the dying were soon overcome by the chanting praise of the Orks. Cries of ""Mang-gler, Mang-gler, Mang-gler"" followed the iron-plated beast as it rampaged through the foe. It was the name that would stick and has been chanted on many battlefields since.
 The pilot of da Mangler is a hulking Nob named Kaptin Grok. In typical Goff fashion, Grok has not let the fact that his Gorkanaut is worshipped as a god go to his head. Instead, he continues to demand the utmost from his krew and reminds the mobs that follow him into battle that ""Dey ain't seen nuffink yet."" 
 Such words might seem like self-aggrandisement to another, more flashy Ork clan, but Grok backs up these sentiments in every battle. When last seen, da Mangler had joined Big Mek Gurk's Stompy Deff Dread Mob -– they were headed off to rack up tank kills on the Ash Wastes.
 Ghazghkull's new WAAAGH! during the Third War for Armageddon attacked the Hive World in a fiery and destructive fashion. In addition to the new tactics and ploys unleashed by Ghazghkull, he also used specially composed shock assault forces to assail his foes. 
 One such specialty assault force were the Speed Freeks, a group of Orks addicted to speed. When they go to war, Speed Freeks do so mounted atop Warbikes, Warbuggies, Trukks or anything that can get them to the battle fast. During his second invasion of Armageddon, Ghazghkull marshalled and released his Speed Freeks to create maximum havoc amongst his foes. Whether deployed in mobs, warbands or even larger formations, Speed Freeks combine quick mobility with hard-hitting offensive capabilities.
 SPEEDBOYZ
 FASTSUNZ
 GRAND WALORD GURTAK'S GO FASTA WARHORDE
 Although he is a Goff, unlike most hidebound WAAAGH!-leaders, Ghazghkull's true genius is that he has embraced all aspects of greenskin warfare. This may be due to the divine touch of Gork and Mork, or simply proof that he is the most tactically-minded Ork of all time.
 Kommandoz are hand-picked troops that range ahead of the main hordes, scouting out enemy positions or performing daring raids behind enemy lines. They are typically deployed in formations of one or two mobs, but Ghazghkull has been known to mass even more for such missions as destroying supply dumps, breaking into hive cities or dismantling enemy artillery. 
 Kommandoz are almost exclusive to the Blood Axes klan -– those sneaky, 'umie-loving Orks that favour camouflage and elaborate strategic plans. Kommandoz work well in Goff warbands, as they have great respect for fighting skill and discipline.
 The Flashblades, the blue-and-white-checked warriors of Dazkrit's Killaz, and the tiger-striped Bloodfangz have all earned a fearsome reputation fighting for WAAAGH! Ghazghkull. Of all the Kommando mobs Ghazghkull ever employed, none have garnered more fame than Boss Snikrot and his Red Skull Kommandoz. To this day, they still haunt the shadows of Armageddon.
 BULRAG'S FIGHTIN' FIFTH
 KRAGGA's KAMO-BOYZ
 RED SKULL KOMMANDOS
 On the ash wastes of Armageddon, Ghazghkull found his mobile Blitz Brigades and even his Stompa Mobs were being hunted by fast-moving Imperial Sentinels, or stalled by mobile counter-attacks from mechanised guardsmen. To combat these enemies without slowing down the main thrust of his advances, Ghazghkull ordered his flanks protected by mobs of Trukk and Battlewagon-mounted Heavy Huntaz, their firepower augmented with a few rokkit-armed Warbuggies. 
 Most of these mobs were small in size, allowing them to respond quickly to different threats to the main armies' flanks. Upon sighting their foes, the transports would peel off and the troops within would deploy at breakneck speeds -- Tankbustas mobs or Lootas soon tracking the Imperial light vehicles. 
 Almost before their feet touched the ground, the Tankbustas would launch a barrage of rokkits towards their foe, easily ripping apart the enemies' light walkers or transport vehicles. Although Lootas needed to plant their feet before firing, the first salvo of shots from their deffguns could rake through whole Sentinel squadrons, cutting off their long gangly legs or, better yet, exploding them into fireballs. 
 Such countermeasures proved extremely effective, and soon more and more light detachments of Heavy Huntaz mobs secured the flanks of all larger warhordes.
 RED ROKKITS HEAVY HUNTAZ
 DREGTOOF'S HEAVY HUNTAZ
 Ghazghkull first used Tellyporta technology after his alliance with Nazdreg. Later perfected by the mad Mek known as Orkimedes, the Tellyporta was a key part of Ghazghkull's second invasion of Armageddon. Ultimately, all sorts of troops and equipment would be teleported onto the planet, but the first and foremost were carefully chosen Tellyporta Mobs. 
 It was their duty to strike fast and hard, driving foes away from the Roks' homing signals. Nobz in Mega Armour were almost always included in the first wave of troops arriving via Tellyporta. Heavily armoured, these powerhouses would materialise with guns blazing –- often using their Kombi-weapons to ensure that their first volley packed the deadliest punch possible. After dousing the target with a good spray of Shoota fire, the Meganobz would wade into combat, hacking down any who dared stand their ground.
 It was Ghazghkull's intention to use his tellyporta mobs to counter the Space Marine offensives which had blighted his first campaign at Armageddon. Indeed, some of his mobs were designated Marine-killas –- their troops outfitted with twin killsaws or special one-shot rokkits to aid in defeating the Space Marines' Power Armour.
 KRIGG'S BIGSNIKKAZ
 GHAZGHKULL'S BULLBOYZ
 Ghazghkull likes to hit his foes hard and fast and few other troops are as brutally effective at this type of lightning warfare as Stormboyz. In WAAAGH! Ghazghkull, mobs of Stormboyz are a common feature in many Ork warbands. 
 Their military-minded way of thinking fits in perfectly with those in the Goff klan. Stormboyz use their Rokkit Packs to launch swift strikes against their enemies –- either assaulting key objectives, taking out vulnerable foes, or, at the least, causing a nuisance that allows the rest of the mobs to move up in range to swing their Choppas.
 After claiming to see visions of Gork's anger descending like a bolt from the skies, Ghazghkull had the bright idea to mass his Stormboyz. He first attempted this with some success during the later stages of the Second War for Armageddon, and since then it has become a proven part of his assault plans. 
 There are few shock assaults more devastating than many mobs of Stormboyz hurtling out of the skies all at once. Without exception, these Stormboyz squads aspire to live long enough to make as big a name for themselves as the infamous Zagstruk and his Vulcha Skwad.
 It is not unusual for Stormboyz in WAAAGH! Ghazghkull to bear the extra black and white checks associated with Goff mobs or a variant of Ghazghkull's personal symbol -– perhaps emblazoned with rokkit fuel or marked by lightning bolts. 
 The Choppa Storm have even developed a rude militaristic marching song which they bellow as they descend to battle, although mercifully the words are typically drowned out by the roar of their Rokkit Packs.
 KROOGA'S AIRBOYZ
 CHOPPA STORM
 
 Battle-scarred and grim, only the hardest of the hard have what it takes to join the Goff Guard. Some of the Orks in Da Goff Guard came from Urk and have stuck by their Warlord through all his many travels. Wherever Ghazghkull can be found, it's rare if Da Goff Guard aren't close to hand. 
 Rightfully proud to be associated with ""da Greatest Greenskin ta live n' breathe"", there are a profusion of back banners, Goff symbols and the Ghazghkull horn-silhouettes amongst Da Goff Guard. Where Ghazghkull leads, da Goff Guard follow. 
 When Ghazghkull smashed down the final blast door and charged the last defences of Hades Hive, it was the Goff Guard that followed. When the Prophet of Gork and Mork cut deep into the Tyranids on Octaria, it was the black armoured might of the Goff Guard that chopped their way behind him.
 During his first invasion of Armageddon the Goff Guard took so many banners and Aquila-topped standards from the Astra Militarum and Adeptus Astartes that they piled them and made a bonfire visible from orbit -– that last bit may be a tall tale they spread around the camps, but who is going to dispute the biggest and baddest Orks who also happen to have the favour of the mightiest of them all -– Ghazghkull himself?
 'ARDSHELLS
 URK's OWN
 GHAZGHKULL's HEAD-BASHAS
 BLACK THUNDA
 KULG's KRUSHAS
 Ghazghkull first appeared in White Dwarf 134. He was the ""Warboss"" of Andy Chambers' sample Goff  army list (notably the weaker of two possible choices for the leader of an Ork army at the time, the other being a ""Warlord""); his ""attributes"" of an adamantium skull and the ability to call on the WAAAGH! were randomly generated -- although at the time they merely conferred an extra headbutt attack in close combat and a minor psychic power, called Hammerhand, that doubled his attacks once per game. 
 The first Ghazghkull model was an in-house conversion. Ghazghkull's next appearance was in the Battle for Armageddon board game, based around the events of the Second War for Armageddon, featured opposite Commissar Yarrick. 
 Inspired by the game's backstory, Jervis Johnson wrote up special rules for the two characters' use in Warhammer 40,000 and Epic 40,000 games, making Ghazghkull one of the first two ""special characters"" ever released by Games Workshop. The special rules were based on the random attributes selected by Andy Chambers back at Ghazghkull's first appearance. 
 Rules for Ghazghkull appeared in the Third Edition of Warhammer 40,000, and a new model was created for the worldwide campaign organised around the the Third War for Armageddon. The rules were updated to reflect Ghazghkull at a point just prior to the outbreak of the Third War.
 It was once a popular theory that the character of Ghazghkull was based on the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher who was infamous for her aggressive personality in Britain in the 1980s. This was because of the character's surname -- Mag Uruk Thraka. As early editions of Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Fantasy Battle often contained elements of comedy or real-world satire, this seemed a real possibility, but was in reality pure fan-speculation. 
 In White Dwarf 292 (AUS), Andy Chambers stated that ""Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka"" roughly translates to ""metal skull/big Orc leader"" in Low Gothic. 
 Chambers reafirmed this translation in a Facebook post, clarifying that the name had emerged from his gaming group's practices while ""live roleplaying"". They would frequently play as monsters, including Orcs. The speech template used for Orcs was based on the Orcish language known as the Black Speech in The Lord of The Rings. This form of speaking allowed monster players to communicate while the adventurers weren't able to understand. 
 Some of the words and meanings included: Mag Uruk Thraka (""big Orc leader""), Ghazghkull (""metal skull"") and ghash-kull (""fire-skull"").
"
Hive Tyrant,"A Hive Tyrant (Tyranicus praefactor) is the massive Tyranid bioform that serves as the main battlefield commander of a Tyranid swarm, a synapse creature that stands above the rank and file Tyranids.
 They wield potent psychic powers but are unaffected by the Daemons of the Warp, a condition that would indicate a lack of a soul at the individual level for most Tyranids. 
 However, the species' gestalt consciousness brings into being a truly potent psychic presence in the Immaterium called the Tyranid ""Shadow in the Warp"" which is produced by the collective Tyranid Hive Mind.
 Hive Tyrants serve as the commanders of all the Tyranid forces deployed on a given battlefield, for they share a special synaptic link to the Hive Mind. This link makes a Hive Tyrant one of the most important of the Tyranid synapse creatures.
 Though individuals display a wide variety of physical characteristics, all Hive Tyrants are fearsome hulking monsters that tower over even a Dreadnought. Like the other Tyranids, they seem to mutate incredibly fast. Unlike the others, the Hive Tyrant evolves from a completely different type of genus, which covers their bodies with hard carapaces.
 Hive Tyrants are highly psychic, and their relationship to the Hive Mind is amongst the closest of any known bioform. Indeed, the synaptic link is so strong that they are the primary conduits through which the Hive Mind enforces its dominance over a hive fleet's lesser creatures. 
 The instinctive nature of a Tyranid swarm is smothered with implacable drive and purpose, and the need to hunt and devour is imbued with a cunning and tactical awareness that would put the galaxy's finest strategists to shame.
 Hive Tyrants were created not only to overpower their prey, but also to outthink it. Unlike many Tyranid creatures, Hive Tyrants are incredibly intelligent and are even, to some extent, self-aware. 
 Whilst they are still slaved to the gestalt consciousness of the Hive Mind, they are given wider latitude in achieving its goals. As such, they can respond to battlefield events far faster than the inscrutable Hive Mind and adapt the behaviour of the swarms they command accordingly.
 As a result of their highly developed synaptic connection and greater levels of intelligence, Hive Tyrants are also able to manifest potent psychic powers. By harnessing tiny slivers of the Hive Mind's terrifying will, Hive Tyrants can invigorate the swarm, shatter their foe's morale or shred the minds of their prey.
 Hive Tyrants embody the Tyranid Hive Mind completely, but their destruction does not in any way diminish it. Death is simply another learning experience that gives insight to the prey's strengths and weaknesses. This goes some way to explain why the Tyranids can rarely be defeated the same way twice. 
 Should a Hive Tyrant be slain on the battlefield, the Hive Mind simply grows a replacement, imbuing it with the same knowledge as its predecessor. Fortunately for the rest of the galaxy, this does not lead to infallibility of purpose. 
 Even the most fearsome Hive Tyrant cannot anticipate its prey's every ploy, nor can it oversee every quarter of the battlefield. However, the Hive Mind's capacity to regrow its fallen leaders does render each Hive Tyrant practically immortal. No matter how many times a Hive Tyrant is killed, sooner or later it will always come back to overcome and devour its prey.
 Should the Hive Mind require it, Hive Tyrants can also be adapted to possess a pair of vast, leathery wings. Winged Hive Tyrants dominate the skies above a battlefield, swooping low to disembowel enemy commanders with a lash of their prehensile tails, or unleashing torrents of flesh-melting energy from monstrous bio-cannons. 
 While such organisms may lack the speed of fighter aircraft, they are perfectly capable of smashing an unaware pilot out of the sky with their bladed hooves, sending burning fragments of his vessel raining onto the ground below.
 Some Hive Tyrants are seen carrying organism-like weapons that spit out large balls of bio-plasma. Apart from their advanced long-ranged weapons, their blood is also known to be extremely acidic, which they sometimes use as a type of weapon. When fighting up close, most of the Hive Tyrants use their claws and even lash-like weapons to smash away the enemies.
"
Imotekh,"Imotekh, also known as Imotekh the Stormlord or simply the Stormlord, is the phaeron of the Sautekh Dynasty and perhaps the strongest and most accomplished Necron Overlord in the galaxy at the end of the 41st Millennium.
 Imotekh rules over a Necron stellar empire currently comprising 80 Tomb Worlds. Renowned for his supreme strategic genius and pride, he has led successful campaigns across entire sectors to expand his growing realm against the lesser sentient races of the galaxy.
 Nemesor Imotekh awoke from the Great Sleep of 60 million standard years to find his Tomb World in disarray. Mandragora had survived the aeons mostly intact, only to fall foul of unrestrained ambition. 
 The Sautekh crownworld's ruling phaeron had been one of the few to perish during hibernation and, once they had quashed immediate alien threats, the remaining Sautekh nobles had moved to seize the throne. A Terran decade of internecine civil war followed, with no faction able to gain victory. 
 During this time, the revivification of high-ranking nobles was suspended, as neither side wished to awaken further competitors. Had the situation continued, Imotekh would likely have slumbered until the civil war had torn Mandragora apart. As it was, one of the pretenders struck upon the idea of recruiting the famous general to his cause -- with such a supporter in thrall, victory could not fail to be his.
 However, when Imotekh awoke, he was both enraged and appalled at the anarchy about him. Realising that Mandragora's only hope of restoration lay in the civil war ending as swiftly as possible, he refused to support either noble faction. Instead, Imotekh marshalled an army of his own, destroyed the chief antagonists, and claimed Mandragora’s throne for himself. 
 The newly crowned phaeron thereafter forbade any form of infighting within his realm, declaring such activities to be a waste of time, effort and resources. This law was ill-observed at first, but quickly became the norm after Imotekh had proven his willingness to make terminal examples of those who flouted his authority. 
 Between this rule of iron and a swift string of military successes against nearby worlds, Imotekh's position became unassailable. Indeed, to this day his only true rival within the Sautekh Dynasty is the famed Nemesor Zahndrekh of the Crownworld of Gidrim, but the old general’s loyalty is as unquestionable as his wits are addled, so he is of little threat.
 Imotekh is a grand strategist, perhaps the most accomplished the galaxy has ever known. His campaigns operate not only across worlds, but across entire star systems and sectors. When Imotekh launches an attack, it is impossible to discern if it is the main thrust of his strategy or simply a decoy raid, created to bleed enemy reinforcements away from a battle yet to come. 
 All such assaults are carefully weighted to overwhelm enemy forces already in place, requiring the foe to either sacrifice his troops or reinforce them -- and Imotekh's plans are always many stages ahead, set to take advantage of either course.
 Indeed, the Stormlord's battle plans are incredibly versatile, seeded with feint attacks, counter-strategies and other contingencies enacted automatically should certain circumstances be triggered or thresholds crossed. 
 To the outside observers, there is something almost mystical to Imotekh's methodology, for how else could he so flawlessly anticipate the unseen? Yet in truth there is nothing more at play here than the careful application of probabilities and logic, combined with a canny understanding of the foe’s mindset.
 So impeccable are the logical patterns behind the Stormlord's strategies that the only way a foe can truly gain meaningful advantage is to abandon all logic themselves -- something that most enemies find incredibly difficult to do. However, Orkish anarchy achieves this as naturally as breathing. 
 Thus does the Stormlord hate Orks above all the lesser races of the galaxy for, no matter how hard he tries, he rarely wins a lasting victory over the rabblesome Greenskins. Yet lasting victories against the Orks there must be, for Imotekh’s goal is nothing less to wipe them from the face of the galaxy.
 The Stormlord is unshakeable in his belief that only when the galaxy is washed clean with the blood of inferior beings will Necron dominance begin anew.
 As phaeron of the Sautekh Dynasty, Imotekh can draw upon incredible resources, for all of the armies of the entire dynasty are his to requisition at need. Yet the Stormlord knows that the foe -- all other sentient life in the galaxy -- is too numerous to be defeated through force of arms alone. 
 Thus, for Imotekh, terror is a weapon as potent as any in the Necron arsenal, and one he employs to full effect. His armies advance under the cover of storm-blackened skies, emerald lightning bolts arcing out from heavy clouds to wreak carnage against the foe. Enemy armies that advance into the shadow of the storm are simply swallowed up, cut off from all contact whilst the battle lasts. 
 Any warriors that escape from the maelstrom’s clutches do so only to sow panic, fear and dismay amongst their comrades. Worse, some such survivors are implanted with Bloodswarm Nanoscarabs, whose gore-warm scent acts as an irresistible beacon for roaming packs of Flayed Ones.
 If the Stormlord has one weakness, it is a prideful need to display his superiority over those enemy commanders foolish enough to stand against him. High ranking enemies are often set free upon their defeat so that they will have to live with the knowledge of their inadequacy. 
 This is a lesson invariably reinforced by physical mutilation -- a severed limb normally being the favoured method. Yet with every battle, these surviving foes learn a little more of the Stormlord's methods and the best of them only become more determined to see his campaigns ended once and for all. 
 High Marshal Helbrecht of the Black Templars in particular, has run the Stormlord close on more than one occasion, though victory has thus far eluded his armoured grasp.
 The fact that Imotekh suffers from such a personal form of martial hubris stands in stark contrast to the analytical and emotionless detachment he displays when planning and conducting campaigns. It is possible that stasis-induced eccentricity is to blame, but for which trait? Is Imotekh a master strategist whose engrammic damage spurs him to seek personal glory, or a bellicose warrior granted strategic genius through an accident of fate? 
 In the end, it does not matter. If Imotekh's defeat comes, it is sure not to be at the hands of a superior strategist, but rather at the hands of a more accomplished warrior. And there will be many opportunities for such a downfall. Imotekh's domain is growing at a rate unparalleled amongst the Necron dynasties. 
 Four score Tomb Worlds lie under his regal command, and five times as many alien-held planets pay direct or indirect tribute -- the number of alien civilisations Imotekh has destroyed during his campaigns cannot easily be counted. 
 Such a realm is nothing when compared to the galaxy-spanning Imperium or the Necron dynasties at the height of the glory during the War in Heaven, but it is nonetheless impressive for the work of a mere two hundred Terran years.
 Such expansion has come at a price, however, and Imotekh's dynasty is now starting to come to the notice of several other realms. On Macragge, reports of Necron activity beyond the Realm of Ultramar's northern borders have reached the attention of Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines. 
 Iyanden's Farseers have sensed a peril before their Craftworld that is, in its way, as great a threat as the Tyranid menace that lies behind them. Rumours of a sinister power on the march have even reached the T'au Empire though, as ever, their prevailing interpretation is one of opportunity rather than threat. 
 It is only a matter of time before the Sautekh Dynasty comes into direct conflict with these other realms, and if forced to war with two or more at the same time, Imotekh’s genius will surely be tested.
